## Reason

This error occurs because the OpenAI Chat Completions API does not allow the simultaneous use of legacy and modern function-calling parameters in a single request. 

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Parameter Conflict**: The API enforces mutual exclusivity between the `functions` and `tools` parameters. Including both triggers a validation error.
2. **Deprecation**: The `functions` parameter is deprecated. OpenAI has transitioned to the `tools` architecture to support enhanced capabilities like Parallel Function Calling.
3. **Schema Incompatibility**: The internal processing logic for `tools` differs from the legacy `functions` pipeline. Mixing them creates an ambiguous request that the API cannot parse.

## Solution
To resolve this error, you must migrate your request structure to the current OpenAI API specifications by following these steps:
1. **Remove the `functions` Parameter**: Delete the `functions` key and its associated array from your API request payload.
2. **Migrate to the `tools` Parameter**: Replace the legacy definition with the `tools` parameter. Unlike the old array of function objects, `tools` requires an array of objects where each item has a `type: "function"` and a `function` object containing the name, description, and parameters.
3. **Update Tool Selection Logic**: If your code uses `function_call` to force or disable a function, change this parameter to `tool_choice` to maintain compatibility with the `tools` parameter.
4. **Verify Request Cleanliness**: Ensure that no legacy fields (like an empty `functions: []` array) remain in the JSON body, as any presence of the key alongside `tools` will cause a 400 Bad Request error.
5. **Check Model Support**: Confirm you are using a model version that supports tools, such as `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, or `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`.
