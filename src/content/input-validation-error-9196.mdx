## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error (specifically `INVALID_ARGUMENT`) in the Google Gemini API occurs when the `GenerateContentRequest` payload fails structural validation. The specific error message `contents.parts: contents.parts must not be empty` indicates that the request was submitted with a content object that lacks the necessary data components.

Key reasons for this failure include:
1.  **Empty Parts Array**: In the Gemini API schema, the `contents` array consists of `Content` objects, and each object must contain a `parts` array. The API requires this `parts` array to have at least one valid element, such as text string (`text`), binary data (`inline_data`), or a file URI (`file_data`).
2.  **Missing or Improperly Formatted Data**: The request may contain an invalid argument where a variable intended for the prompt (e.g., a text string or an image) is null, undefined, or an empty array at the time of the API call.
3.  **Client-Side Malformation**: This is a client-side issue where the JSON payload sent to the server does not conform to the required API contract. This can happen during complex operations like multi-turn chats or when dynamically building prompts where logic fails to populate the final content structure.

## Solution
To resolve the `400 Bad Request` error and ensure the `GenerateContentRequest` is valid, follow these remediation steps:
1.  **Populate the Parts Field**: Ensure that the `contents.parts` array contains at least one piece of data. For a simple text prompt, the structure should look like `"contents": [{"parts": [{"text": "Your prompt here"}]}]`.
2.  **Verify Required Fields**: Check that all required fields in the `GenerateContentRequest` are present and correctly formatted. Ensure you are not passing empty strings or null values to the `parts` array.
3.  **Validate Arguments**: Verify that variables used to build the request (such as image buffers or text inputs) are properly initialized before being passed to the Generative AI SDK or REST endpoint.
4.  **Clear Local State**: If you are experiencing this error within a web-based testing tool or IDE, clear any corrupted cache or cookies that might be interfering with the request headers or session data.
5.  **Audit Browser Extensions**: Disable browser extensions or add-ons that could be modifying or stripping data from outgoing HTTP requests, especially if you are using Google AI Studio or other web-based playgrounds.
