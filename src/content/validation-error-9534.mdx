title: "1 validation error for Request body -> assistant_id field required (type=value_error.missing)"

## Reason

The OpenAI API returns a 400 status error with the message `field required (type=value_error.missing)` for `assistant_id` when a request is submitted without the mandatory Assistant identifier in the request body.

This error occurs because the specific endpoint you are calling (most commonly the **Create Run** or **Create Thread and Run** endpoints) requires the `assistant_id` parameter to determine which Assistant should process the messages. The API uses strict validation to ensure all required fields are present and populated with valid values; if the field is missing, empty, or misspelled in the JSON payload, the request is rejected as improperly formatted.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 validation error and ensure your request is properly configured, follow these steps:
1.  **Retrieve the Assistant ID**: Ensure you have created an Assistant via the OpenAI Dashboard or the API. The ID should be a string starting with `asst_` (e.g., `asst_abc123...`).
2.  **Include the assistant_id in the Request Body**: Explicitly add the `assistant_id` field to your JSON payload. For example, when creating a Run, your body should look like this:
    `{ "assistant_id": "asst_your_id_here" }`.
3.  **Verify API Documentation**: Consult the OpenAI API reference for the specific endpoint you are using to identify all required parameters. Some endpoints may also require a `thread_id` or `model` field.
4.  **Validate the JSON Payload**: Ensure your request body is well-formed JSON. Use a JSON linter to check for syntax errors such as missing commas or mismatched brackets that might lead to validation failures.
5.  **Check Header Requirements**: For Assistants API features, ensure you are including the required `OpenAI-Beta: assistants=v2` (or current version) header in your request.
6.  **Review Full Error Details**: Examine the complete error response from the API, as it may list multiple missing fields if your request body is significantly incomplete.
