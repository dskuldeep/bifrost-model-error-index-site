Image URL is invalid.
```

## Reason

The error message indicates a `400 Bad Request` status, specifically highlighting a failure to download an image because the provided URL is invalid. This error occurs when the OpenAI API cannot process the request due to client-side issues. Key reasons include:

*   **Invalid or Inaccessible Image URL**: The URL provided in the request may be malformed, missing the protocol (e.g., `https://`), or point to a private resource that OpenAI's servers cannot reach. For vision tasks, images must be publicly accessible or provided as base64 encoded strings.
*   **Expired Links**: If the URL was generated by an OpenAI service (such as DALL-E), these links are temporary and typically expire within one hour.
*   **Malformed Parameters**: The request may be missing required fields or contain syntax errors in the JSON payload. For example, providing an image input to a model that does not support vision will trigger this error.
*   **Authentication Issues**: The API key used might be incorrect, expired, or lack the necessary permissions for the specific model being called.
*   **Model-Specific Errors**: Intermittent `400` errors can occur if the request specifies dimensions or parameters that are incompatible with the chosen model's specifications.
*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Exceeding organizational quotas or failing to handle rate limit headers correctly can result in a rejected request.
*   **Network and Proxy Configurations**: Local network issues, firewall rules, or SSL certificate problems can interfere with the request data, leading to a malformed transmission.

## Solution
To resolve the `400` error and the image download failure, follow these troubleshooting steps:

**Image and URL Verification**
1.  **Test URL Accessibility**: Ensure the image URL is publicly reachable by opening it in an incognito browser window. If it requires a login, the OpenAI API will not be able to download it.
2.  **Check Image Format**: Verify the image is in a supported format, such as JPEG, PNG, WEBP, or non-animated GIF.
3.  **Use Base64 Encoding**: As a more reliable alternative to URLs, encode the image as a base64 string and pass it directly in the data field of the request.
4.  **Monitor Expiration**: If using DALL-E generated URLs, ensure they are processed immediately before the 60-minute expiration window closes.

**API and Credential Checks**
1.  **Validate API Key**: Check your OpenAI dashboard to ensure the API key is active and has not been revoked.
2.  **Verify Model Compatibility**: Ensure the `model` parameter is set to a version that supports the input type (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4-turbo` for vision-related tasks).
3.  **Review Request Structure**: Compare your JSON payload against the official OpenAI API documentation to ensure all required parameters are present and correctly typed.

**Environment and Network Setup**
1.  **Check Network Settings**: Verify that your proxy or firewall is not blocking outbound requests to `api.openai.com` or stripping essential headers.
2.  **Rate Limit Management**: Implement exponential backoff in your code to handle rate limiting gracefully.
3.  **Audit Organization IDs**: If you belong to multiple organizations, ensure the correct `OpenAI-Organization` header is being sent.
