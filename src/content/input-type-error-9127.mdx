title: "\"sadasdas\" is not of type \"number\" - \"temperature\""

## Reason

The error occurs because the OpenAI API expects the `temperature` parameter to be a numeric data type, but it received a string instead. In your specific request, the value `"sadasdas"` was provided as a string, which violates the API's schema requirements. This data type mismatch results in an HTTP 400 Bad Request error, as the server cannot process the invalid syntax.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error related to the `temperature` parameter, ensure the value provided is a valid number. Follow these steps:
1. **Convert to Numeric Type**: Replace the string value (e.g., `"sadasdas"`) with a raw float or integer.
2. **Adhere to Valid Range**: Ensure the numeric value is between 0 and
2. While 2.0 is the technical maximum, it is generally recommended to stay between 0 and 1 for more stable and coherent results.
3. **Cast Variables**: If you are pulling the temperature value from an environment variable or a database, explicitly cast it to a number in your code (for example, using `parseFloat()` in JavaScript or `float()` in Python) before sending the request.

**Examples of Correct Usage:**

- **JSON**: `"temperature": 0.7` 
- **Python**: `temperature=0.5` 
- **Node.js**: `temperature: 1` 

Avoid using any non-numeric characters or enclosing the number in quotation marks.
