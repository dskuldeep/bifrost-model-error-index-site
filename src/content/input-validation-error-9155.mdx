## Reason

The **400 Bad Request** error with the message `"role" is a required property - "messages.1"` occurs when an OpenAI API request fails schema validation. This specific error indicates that the second message object in your `messages` array (index 1) is missing the mandatory `role` field.

In the Chat Completions API, the `messages` parameter must be an array of message objects. Each object in this array is strictly required to have a `role` property that defines the speaker's context. If any object in the array—regardless of its position—omits this key, the OpenAI server will reject the entire payload as malformed.

## Solution
To resolve this validation error, ensure that every object within the `messages` array conforms to the OpenAI API specification. Follow these remediation steps:
1. **Inspect the Message at Index 1**: Locate the second object in your `messages` array. Confirm it contains the `role` key.
2. **Include Required Properties**: Every message object must include both `role` and `content`. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "user",
     "content": "Hello!"
   }
   ```
3. **Validate Role Values**: Ensure the value assigned to `role` is one of the supported strings:
   * `system`: Used to set the behavior of the assistant.
   * `user`: Used for instructions or queries provided by the end user.
   * `assistant`: Used for previous responses generated by the model.
   * `tool`: Used for results returned from tool/function calls.
4. **Check for Empty Objects**: Ensure you haven't accidentally included trailing commas or empty objects `{}` in the array, as these will trigger the same validation failure.
5. **Verify Array Structure**: Ensure the `messages` parameter is a flat array of objects and not nested arrays or a single string.
