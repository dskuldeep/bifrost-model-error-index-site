## Reason

The Azure OpenAI API returns a 400 Bad Request error when the request payload fails schema validation. In this specific instance, the error message `"1719 is not of type 'string' - 'user'"` indicates that the value assigned to the `user` property is an integer (1719) rather than the required string format.

Key causes include:
1.  **Invalid Data Type for 'user' Field**: The `user` parameter is an optional field intended to help track and monitor end-user activity for abuse detection. It must always be a string. Passing a numeric ID without quotes causes a type mismatch.
2.  **Incorrect Request Configuration**: Structural issues in the JSON payload, such as improper nesting of the `messages` array or providing non-string values to properties that strictly require them, will trigger validation failures.
3.  **Missing Required Properties**: If mandatory fields like `role` or `content` within the messages array are missing or formatted as null/numeric, the API rejects the request.
4.  **Payload Size or Content Violations**: Large payloads exceeding token limits or content that triggers automated safety filters may occasionally result in rejection, though type validation is the primary driver for this specific error string.

## Solution
To resolve the type validation error, ensure the request payload adheres strictly to the Azure OpenAI API schema. Follow these steps:
1.  **Enforce String Types**: Convert the `user` field value and any other string-only fields to a string format. For example, change `"user": 1719` to `"user": "1719"`.
2.  **Validate Request Structure**: Verify that the JSON body is correctly structured. The `messages` property must be an array of objects, and each object should typically contain a `role` (string) and `content` (string).
3.  **Check Required Fields**: Ensure that all mandatory parameters for the specific API endpoint (e.g., `model`, `messages`) are included and correctly typed.
4.  **Audit Payload Constraints**: Confirm the payload size does not exceed the deployment's quota and that the content complies with Azure's content management policies.

**Best Practices for Implementation:**

*   Use a JSON validator or a language-specific SDK (like the Azure OpenAI SDK for Python or .NET) to ensure objects are serialized correctly.
*   Explicitly cast numeric identifiers to strings before including them in the API request body.
