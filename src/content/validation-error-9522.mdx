## Reason

The HTTP 400 Bad Request error `'parameters' is a required property - 'functions.0'` occurs when the Azure OpenAI API receives a request containing a function definition that lacks the mandatory JSON Schema `parameters` field. 

Key causes include:
1. **Missing Mandatory Property**: In the `functions` array of your request payload, the first function object (index 0) is missing the `parameters` key. The API requires this field even if the function accepts no arguments.
2. **Incorrect Schema Structure**: The request payload may be malformed or fail to follow the strict JSON Schema requirements expected by the Azure OpenAI API for function calling.
3. **API Version Compatibility**: Using an API version that supports function calling (such as `2023-07-01-preview` or later) without adhering to the specific schema requirements for that version. Older versions may not recognize the function calling parameters correctly, or newer versions may have stricter validation rules.
4. **Invalid JSON Payload**: Syntax errors or incorrectly named fields in the JSON body can prevent the server from correctly parsing the `parameters` property, leading to a validation failure.

## Solution
To resolve the `'parameters' is a required property` error, ensure that every function definition in your `functions` array includes a valid `parameters` object. Follow these steps:
1. **Verify the Function Schema**: Check the first item in your `functions` array (`functions[0]`). Ensure it contains a `parameters` key. If your function does not require any input arguments, the `parameters` property should still be present and defined as an empty JSON Schema object:

```json
"parameters": {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {}
}
```
2. **Check JSON Payload Integrity**: Validate that your entire request body is a correctly formatted JSON string. Ensure there are no trailing commas or missing brackets that could cause the `parameters` field to be ignored by the parser.
3. **Align with API Version**: Confirm you are using a supported Azure OpenAI API version (e.g., `2023-07-01-preview`, `2023-12-01-preview`, or `2024-02-15-preview`). Ensure your implementation matches the specific requirements of that version.
4. **Example of a Correct Function Definition**: Ensure your structure matches this pattern:

```json
{
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get the current weather",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "location": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "required": ["location"]
  }
}
```
5. **Transition to Tools (Optional)**: If you are using newer models (like GPT-4 Turbo), consider migrating from the deprecated `functions` parameter to the `tools` parameter, which uses a similar but updated structure.
