## Reason

The 404 status error occurs when the Anthropic API receives a request for a model identifier it does not recognize. In this instance, the error is caused by a provider-model mismatch where the user is attempting to call an OpenAI model via an Anthropic endpoint.

Key reasons include:
1. **Model Not Found**: The identifier `gpt-4o-mini` belongs to the **OpenAI** model family. Anthropic’s API (which hosts the Claude family of models) cannot fulfill requests for OpenAI models, resulting in a "Resource Not Found" error.
2. **Access Restrictions**: API keys are provider-specific. Your Anthropic API key does not have permissions to access OpenAI models, and the Anthropic server will reject the request as the resource is outside its catalog.
3. **Configuration Mismatch**: This error often arises when using multi-provider SDKs or proxies (such as Bifrost or LiteLLM) where the provider is incorrectly set to `anthropic` while the model is set to an OpenAI string.

## Solution
To resolve the 404 status error when using the model `gpt-4o-mini`, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Verify Model Provider**: Determine which provider you intended to use. 
   - If you want to use `gpt-4o-mini`, ensure your API base URL is set to OpenAI (`api.openai.com`) and that you are using an OpenAI API key.
   - If you want to use the Anthropic API, you must use a Claude model name.
2. **Update to a Valid Claude Model**: If you are calling Anthropic, replace `gpt-4o-mini` with a supported identifier, such as:
   - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
   - `claude-3-opus-20230229` 
   - `claude-3-haiku-20240307`
3. **Check API Key and Environment**: Confirm that your environment variables (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) are correctly paired with the corresponding provider's SDK or client configuration.
4. **Review API Documentation**: Consult the official Anthropic documentation to verify the exact string for current model versions and ensure they are available for your specific account tier.
5. **Contact Support**: If the correct Anthropic model name still yields a 404, contact Anthropic support. Be sure to include the `request-id` from the API response headers to help them diagnose potential account-level restrictions.
