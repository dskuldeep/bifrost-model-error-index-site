## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error occurs when an audio file submitted to OpenAI's transcription or translation endpoints (Whisper) fails to meet the minimum duration threshold of **0.1 seconds** (100 milliseconds).

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Invalid Request Duration**: The most direct cause is providing a file where the actual audio content is shorter than the API's hard limit. OpenAI requires at least 0.1 seconds of data to perform feature extraction.
2. **Empty or Corrupt Buffers**: If the audio is captured via a stream or a temporary buffer that fails to initialize or terminate correctly, the resulting file may have a header but contain zero or near-zero duration data.
3. **Syntax or Configuration Issues**: The API server interprets the insufficient file length as a malformed request, as it cannot process the payload using the specified audio parameters or model configurations.

## Solution
To resolve the "Audio file is too short" error, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Verify Audio Length**: Use a tool like FFmpeg or an audio library (such as `pydub` or `wave`) to inspect the file metadata. Ensure the duration is strictly greater than 0.1 seconds before sending the request.
2. **Handle Short Files in Code**: Implement a client-side check to skip or pad audio segments that do not meet the 100ms requirement. This prevents unnecessary API calls and 400-level errors.
3. **Concatenate Audio Files**: If you are processing a stream of short clips, concatenate multiple segments into a single file that exceeds the minimum length.
4. **Check File Format and Integrity**: Ensure the file is not corrupted and is in a supported format. OpenAI's Whisper API supports: `mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `wav`, and `webm`.
5. **Review API Request Structure**: Ensure the request is formatted as `multipart/form-data` and that the file parameter is correctly populated with the binary data of the audio file.
