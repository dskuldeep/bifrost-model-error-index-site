## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error with the message `'0.1' is not of type 'number' - 'temperature'` indicates a schema validation failure within the OpenAI API. This occurs for the following reasons:
1. **Incorrect Data Type**: The most common cause is passing the `temperature` value as a string (e.g., `'0.1'`) instead of a numeric literal (e.g., `0.1`). The API expects a float or integer, and quoting the value causes the JSON parser to interpret it as a string.
2. **Invalid Parameter Value**: The OpenAI API enforces specific constraints on the `temperature` parameter. If the value is not a valid number or falls outside the expected constraints of the model's schema, a 400 error is triggered. For instance, while most models default to 1, they strictly require the input to be numeric.

## Solution
To resolve this error and ensure the `temperature` parameter is accepted, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Convert to Numeric Type**: Ensure that the `temperature` value is passed as a numeric type. If you are pulling the value from an environment variable or a text input field, explicitly cast it to a number (e.g., `parseFloat(temp)` in JavaScript or `float(temp)` in Python) before sending the request.
2. **Verify Supported Ranges**: Ensure the temperature value is within the standard supported range, which is typically between 0 and
2. Values outside this range may be rejected by the API's validation logic.
3. **Check Model Compatibility**: Confirm that the specific model you are using supports the provided temperature value. While the 0 to 2 range is standard for models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, specific model versions or configurations may have different requirements.

**Key Actions Summary**:
1. Remove quotes around the value to ensure it is sent as `0.1` rather than `'0.1'`.
2. Validate that the chosen value is between 0 and
2.
3. Verify the API request body structure matches the OpenAI documentation for the specific model endpoint.
