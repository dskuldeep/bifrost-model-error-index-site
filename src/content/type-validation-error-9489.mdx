## Reason

The 400 Bad Request error `'false' is not of type 'boolean' - 'stream'` occurs when the Azure OpenAI API's JSON schema validator encounters a data type mismatch. 

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Incorrect Data Type**: The `stream` parameter in the request payload expects a primitive boolean value (`true` or `false`). If the value is passed as a string (e.g., `'false'` or `"false"`), the API's validation layer rejects the request.
2. **Strict Schema Validation**: Azure OpenAI enforces rigorous type checking on its input parameters. Any deviation from the defined JSON schema, such as quoting boolean or integer values, will trigger a validation error.
3. **Malformed Request Configuration**: The error indicates that the JSON body is not being correctly interpreted or parsed by the endpoint, often due to how the payload is constructed in code or within integration platforms like Flowise or Logic Apps.
4. **Payload Integrity Issues**: General issues with the JSON structure, such as missing required properties or incorrectly nested fields, can lead to the API being unable to map values to their respective data types.

## Solution
To fix this error, you must ensure the `stream` parameter and the overall JSON payload conform to the API's expected types.

**1. Correct the Data Type Syntax**
Update the payload to use a literal boolean value for `stream`. Do not wrap the value in quotes:
- **Incorrect**: `"stream": "false"` or `"stream": 'false'`
- **Correct**: `"stream": false`

**2. Validate JSON Payload Structure**
Ensure that the request body is valid JSON. Use a JSON linter to confirm the formatting and check that all parameters are at the correct nesting level required by the Azure OpenAI Chat Completion or Completion API.

**3. Verify Headers and Base URL**
Check that your request configuration includes the necessary headers, particularly `Content-Type: application/json`, and that the `api-key` or `Authorization` headers are correctly set.

**4. Review Model-Specific Parameters**
Depending on the model deployment (e.g., GPT-4 vs. o1-series), check the usage of token limits:
- Verify if the model requires `max_tokens` or the newer `max_completion_tokens` parameter.
- Ensure no conflicting parameters are set that might interfere with the `stream` functionality.

**5. Check Integration Platform Settings**
If using a low-code tool (like Power Automate, Bubble, or Flowise), ensure the toggle or field for 'stream' is explicitly set to a boolean output rather than a dynamic string value.
