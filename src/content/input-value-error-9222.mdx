title: "Logit bias value -1000 is invalid or outside of range [-100, 100]"

## Reason

The error occurs because the `logit_bias` parameter in the OpenAI API request contains a value that falls outside the strictly enforced range of -100 to 100. 

Key points regarding this error include:

*   **Range Constraint:** The OpenAI Chat Completions API requires `logit_bias` values to be integers between -100 and 100. A value such as -1000 is mathematically invalid for this parameter.
*   **Functionality:** The `logit_bias` parameter is used to modify the likelihood of specific tokens appearing in the model's output. A value of -100 results in a complete ban of the token, while a value of 100 results in the exclusive selection of that token.
*   **Request Failure:** When a value outside this range is provided, the server returns a `400 Bad Request` status code because it cannot process the invalid input.
*   **Model Compatibility:** Some newer models, specifically those in the OpenAI **o1** series (such as `o1-preview` and `o1-mini`), do not support the `logit_bias` parameter. Including it in requests to these models will also result in an error.

## Solution
To resolve this error and ensure your request is processed correctly, follow these remediation steps:
1.  **Validate Parameter Range:** Review the `logit_bias` object in your API call. Ensure every value assigned to a token ID is an integer within the range of -100 to 100.
2.  **Verify Model Support:** Check if the specific model you are using supports `logit_bias`. 
    *   Models like `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo` support this parameter.
    *   The **o1** reasoning models currently do not support `logit_bias` during their beta period.
3.  **Adjust Model Choice:** If your application requires the use of `logit_bias` to constrain outputs and your current model does not support it, switch to a compatible model like `gpt-4o`.
4.  **Check Token IDs:** Ensure that the keys provided in the `logit_bias` dictionary are valid token IDs associated with the tokenizer used by the model (e.g., the `cl100k_base` tokenizer for GPT-4).
