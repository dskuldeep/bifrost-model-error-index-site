## Reason

The error `'' is not one of ['system', 'assistant', 'user', 'function'] - 'messages.1.role'` indicates that the OpenAI API received a message object where the `role` parameter was an empty string. The API requires every message in the `messages` array to have a valid `role` assigned to it.

In the OpenAI Chat Completions schema, the `role` field is mandatory and acts as a discriminator to tell the model how to interpret the content. The error specifically points to `messages.1.role`, which identifies the second element (index 1) in your message array as the source of the failure. If this field is null, empty, or set to a value outside the permitted list, the server returns a 400 Bad Request status code because the request does not conform to the expected JSON schema.

## Solution
To resolve this issue, you must ensure that every message object in your request includes a properly defined `role`. Follow these steps to remediate the error:
1. **Identify the empty field**: Check your code for where the `messages` array is constructed. Specifically, look at the second item (index 1) to see if the `role` variable is being passed as an empty string or is missing entirely.
2. **Assign a valid role**: Set the `role` parameter to one of the following accepted strings:
   - `system`: Used for instructions that guide the model's behavior.
   - `user`: Used for messages sent by the end-user.
   - `assistant`: Used for messages previously generated by the model to provide conversation history.
   - `function` or `tool`: Used specifically for providing the results of tool/function calls.
3. **Validate dynamic inputs**: If your application dynamically generates the `role` (e.g., mapping from a database or external API), implement a check to ensure the value is not null, undefined, or an empty string before sending the request.
4. **Check model compatibility**: For newer models like the `o1` series, note that the `system` role may be replaced or supplemented by the `developer` role. Verify that the role you are using is supported by the specific model version you have targeted.
