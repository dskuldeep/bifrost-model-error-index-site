## Reason

The "400 Bad Request" error in the OpenAI API, specifically the message "Additional properties are not allowed ('chiontent' was unexpected) - 'messages.0'," indicates that the request sent to the API contains invalid or unexpected parameters that fail schema validation.

Key reasons for this error include:

* **Invalid Syntax or Configuration**: The API request contains syntax errors or configuration properties that are not recognized by the OpenAI endpoint. 
* **Typographical Errors**: In this specific instance, the property `chiontent` is a typo for the required `content` field. Because the API does not recognize `chiontent`, it treats it as an illegal additional property.
* **Incorrect Request Format**: The structure of the `messages` parameter does not match the expected JSON schema. OpenAI expects specific keys (such as `role` and `content`) within the message objects; any keys outside of the official specification will trigger a validation failure.
* **Schema Validation Enforcement**: The API performs strict schema validation on all incoming requests. Any property not explicitly defined in the API documentation for that specific version/endpoint will result in a "Bad Request" response.

## Solution
To resolve the "400 Bad Request" error and satisfy the API's schema requirements, follow these steps:
1. **Correct Typographical Errors**: Locate the unexpected property (e.g., `chiontent`) in your code and change it to the correct parameter name (e.g., `content`).
2. **Remove Unauthorized Properties**: Review the objects within the `messages` array. Ensure they only contain supported keys such as `role`, `content`, `name`, or `tool_calls`. Remove any custom metadata or internal fields that are not part of the OpenAI specification.
3. **Align with API Documentation**: Ensure the request structure matches the format defined in the OpenAI Chat Completions API reference. The `messages` field must be an array of objects.
4. **Verify Mandatory Fields**: Check that all required fields for each message object are present and correctly formatted. For example, most messages require both a `role` (system, user, or assistant) and `content` string.
5. **Audit Request Logic**: Check for any syntax or configuration errors in the request construction logic, such as accidental nesting or incorrect variable mapping in your application's API client.
