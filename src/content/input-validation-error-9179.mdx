## Reason

The Together AI API returns a **400 Bad Request** error with the message "inputs cannot be empty" when a request is submitted without the necessary text or data payload required for processing. 

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Missing Required Fields**: The request body lacks the `prompt` or `messages` field required by the specific endpoint being used.
2. **Empty Content**: The value provided for the input field is an empty string (`""`), an empty array, or `null`.
3. **Validation Criteria**: The API performs a validation check to ensure it has enough context to generate a response; submitting a request that meets the technical JSON structure but lacks actual text content will fail this check.

## Solution
To resolve input validation errors in the Together AI API, ensure your request adheres to the following steps:
1. **Verify Input Data**: Check that your `prompt` or `messages` content is not empty. Ensure that any variables used to populate these fields are resolving to non-empty strings before the API call is made.
2. **Check API Request Format**: Validate that your JSON payload is properly structured. Use a JSON linter to ensure there are no syntax errors and confirm the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`.
3. **Ensure Required Fields**: Include all mandatory parameters based on the endpoint:
   - For **Chat Completions**, the `messages` array must be present and contain at least one message object with valid `content`.
   - For **Completions**, the `prompt` field must be present.
4. **Review API Documentation**: Consult the Together AI documentation to confirm the exact parameter names and requirements for the specific model you are using, as some models may have unique validation rules.
