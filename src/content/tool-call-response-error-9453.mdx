## Reason

The OpenAI API returns a `400 Bad Request` error when the sequence of messages in a request violates the required protocol for tool calling. When an assistant message contains a `tool_calls` array, the API expects the conversation history to immediately provide a corresponding response for every individual `tool_call_id` generated by the model.

This specific error occurs because:
1.  **Missing Response Messages:** One or more tool calls (such as `call_IgY8KfYmUElkJC2OkNmF44z3`) were initiated by the assistant, but no message with the role `tool` and the matching `tool_call_id` was provided in the subsequent message array.
2.  **Strict Ordering Requirements:** The API requires that `tool` role messages follow the assistant's request directly. Inserting a `user` or `system` message between the tool call and its response will trigger this error.
3.  **Parallel Call Incompleteness:** If the assistant requests multiple tool calls simultaneously (parallel function calling), every single ID in that request must have a matching response message. Leaving even one ID unanswered results in an invalid request.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 error and correctly handle tool calls, ensure your message array follows the strict structure required by the Chat Completions API. Follow these steps:
1.  **Identify Unanswered IDs:** Check the error message to find the specific `tool_call_id` that is missing a response.
2.  **Append Tool Role Messages:** For every `tool_call_id` generated by the assistant, append a new message to your `messages` array with the property `role: "tool"`.
3.  **Match IDs Exactly:** Ensure the `tool_call_id` field in your tool response message matches the `id` string provided in the assistant's message exactly.
4.  **Verify Message Sequence:** Ensure the conversation flow adheres to this order: `User` -> `Assistant (with tool_calls)` -> `Tool (with tool_call_id)` -> `Assistant (final response)`. Do not place other messages between the assistant's tool call and the tool's response.
5.  **Reconstruct the Conversation History:** If you are building the request dynamically, verify that your state management logic includes all previous tool interactions. The API is stateless, so the entire sequence of tool calls and responses must be re-sent in each request to maintain context.
6.  **Update Code Logic:** Ensure your application logic is capable of iterating through the `tool_calls` array and generating a response for each item before calling the API again.
