## Reason

The "400 Bad Request" error occurs when the OpenAI API cannot process a request due to invalid client-side parameters or configurations. Specifically, the error message **"The size is not supported by this model"** is a common manifestation of this status code when there is a mismatch between a requested size parameter and the specific model's capabilities.

Key reasons for this issue include:
1. **Model-Specific Size Constraints:** The most common cause is requesting an image resolution or vector dimension that the model does not support. For example, DALL-E 3 requires a minimum resolution of 1024x1024, while smaller sizes like 256x256 or 512x512 are only supported by DALL-E
2. Similarly, using the `dimensions` parameter on older embedding models like `text-embedding-ada-002` will trigger this error, as they only support a fixed vector size.
2. **Invalid Request Syntax or Configuration:** The request may contain malformed data, missing required properties (such as the `content` field), or incorrect headers.
3. **Incorrect or Expired API Keys:** An invalid or expired API key prevents the server from authenticating the request, leading to a general 400 error.
4. **Data Payload Size:** Sending a payload that exceeds the maximum token limit or byte size for the model. This includes prompts that are too long or large file uploads.
5. **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Exceeding the Requests Per Minute (RPM) or Tokens Per Minute (TPM) quotas assigned to your account tier.
6. **Input Validation Issues:** Unsanitized inputs, such as leading or trailing newlines or the presence of control characters (like U+0004), can cause the API to reject the JSON body as invalid.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 Bad Request error and the "size not supported" message, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Validate Model-Specific Parameters:**
   * **For Image Generation:** If using `dall-e-3`, ensure the `size` parameter is set to one of the supported resolutions: `1024x1024`, `1024x1792`, or `1792x1024`. For `dall-e-2`, you can use `256x256`, `512x512`, or `1024x1024`.
   * **For Embeddings:** Verify if the model supports the `dimensions` parameter. Only newer models like `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` support it. If using legacy models, remove the `dimensions` parameter from your request.
2. **Check API Keys and Authentication:**
   * Verify that your API key is active and correctly copied from the OpenAI Developer Dashboard.
   * Ensure the `Authorization` header is correctly formatted as `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.
3. **Sanitize Input Text:**
   * Strip leading and trailing newlines from your prompt or input documents.
   * Remove control characters or non-standard whitespace that might interfere with JSON parsing.
4. **Audit Data Payload:**
   * Ensure the total request size is within the model's context window and the API's maximum payload limit.
5. **Manage Rate Limits:**
   * Implement exponential backoff in your code to handle 429 errors that may occasionally present as 400 errors during high-traffic periods.
   * Monitor your usage in the OpenAI dashboard to stay within your tier's TPM/RPM limits.
6. **Review Request Syntax:**
   * Use a JSON linter to ensure your request body is correctly structured and contains all mandatory parameters for the specific endpoint.
