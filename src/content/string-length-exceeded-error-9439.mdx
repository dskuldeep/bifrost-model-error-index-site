## Reason

The error occurs because a single text string within the `messages` array exceeds the maximum character limit allowed by the OpenAI API. This is a structural constraint on the API's JSON payload rather than a model-specific token limit.

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Character Limit Violation**: The OpenAI API enforces a strict limit of **1,048,576 characters** (approximately 1MB of text) for the `messages.content.text` field.
2. **Payload Size**: In this specific instance, the request sent a string with a length of 3,235,717 characters, which is more than triple the allowed threshold.
3. **Status Code 400**: When this limit is exceeded, the server rejects the request immediately with a `400 Bad Request` error before any model processing occurs.

## Solution
To resolve the "Invalid 'messages.content.text': string too long" error, you must ensure your request string stays within the 1,048,576 character limit. Implement the following remediation steps:
1. **Trim or Truncate the Text**: Measure the character length of your input before sending the API call. If it exceeds the limit, programmatically truncate the string to 1,048,576 characters or fewer.
2. **Split the Text**: Break down large documents or long strings into multiple messages. You can send these in chunks or as a sequence of user messages within the same thread to maintain context without hitting single-string limits.
3. **Use a Summarization Approach**: If the full text is not required for the specific prompt, use a preprocessing step to summarize the content, extracting only the most relevant information to fit within the allowed length.
4. **Optimize the Request Payload**: Review the request construction to ensure no unnecessary metadata or redundant text is being passed in the `content` field.
5. **Use File-Based Processing**: For massive datasets that consistently exceed payload limits, consider using the OpenAI Files API or the Assistants API with file attachments. This allows the model to retrieve information from a file rather than requiring the entire text to be passed as a raw string in the JSON body.
