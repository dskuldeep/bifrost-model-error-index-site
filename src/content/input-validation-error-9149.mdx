## Reason

The error `'Browse graph' does not match '^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$'` occurs because the name assigned to a tool or function in the OpenAI API request does not adhere to the required naming conventions. 

Specifically, the validation fails due to the following constraints defined by the regex pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`:
1. **Permitted Characters**: Only alphanumeric characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers), underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`) are allowed.
2. **Prohibited Characters**: Spaces and special symbols (such as `!`, `@`, `#`, or `.`) are strictly forbidden. The name "Browse graph" contains a space, which is the primary cause of this validation failure.
3. **Length Requirement**: The name must be between 1 and 64 characters long. 

This validation applies to the `name` field within the `tools` or `functions` array in the Chat Completions and Assistants APIs.

## Solution
To fix the error, you must rename the function or tool to comply with the regex requirements. Follow these steps:
1. **Remove or Replace Illegal Characters**: Identify any spaces or unsupported special characters in the name. Replace them with underscores (`_`) or hyphens (`-`).
2. **Shorten if Necessary**: Ensure the total character count of the name does not exceed 64 characters.
3. **Consistency Check**: Update all references to this function name in your codebase, including the function definition provided to the API and any logic that handles the model's tool call requests.

**Corrected Examples for "Browse graph":**

- `Browse_graph` (using an underscore)
- `Browse-graph` (using a hyphen)
- `BrowseGraph` (using CamelCase)
