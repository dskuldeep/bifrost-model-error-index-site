## Reason

The `529` status error in the Anthropic API, technically identified as an `overloaded_error`, occurs when the server is temporarily unable to process requests due to excessive demand. This error is distinct from a `429` (Rate Limit Error) because it indicates a global infrastructure strain rather than a limit specific to your account.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **High Traffic**: Sudden spikes in global request volume from multiple users can saturate the API's processing capacity.
2. **Resource Limitations**: The API infrastructure may face temporary bottlenecks in computational resources, such as GPU/CPU availability, memory, or network bandwidth.
3. **Maintenance or Updates**: Anthropic may perform scheduled maintenance or deploy backend updates that temporarily reduce the available capacity for handling requests.
4. **Resource-Intensive Requests**: Submitting extremely long prompts, high `max_tokens` values, or complex queries can put additional strain on the system during peak periods.

## Solution
To resolve the `529 overloaded_error`, implement the following resilience and optimization strategies:
1. **Wait and Retry with Exponential Backoff**: This is a transient error. You should wait and retry the request. It is highly recommended to use an exponential backoff strategy (e.g., retrying after 1s, then 2s, 4s, etc.) to allow the server time to recover.
2. **Implement Client-Side Rate Limiting**: Ensure your application limits the number of concurrent requests sent to the API to avoid worsening the server overload.
3. **Optimize Request Payloads**: Make your requests as lightweight as possible. For long-running tasks, use the streaming Messages API or Message Batches API to reduce connection overhead and server load.
4. **Monitor API Usage**: Use monitoring and logging tools to track when these errors occur, allowing you to identify peak times and shift non-critical workloads to off-peak hours.
5. **Check Service Status**: Regularly verify the official Anthropic status page for ongoing outages or maintenance windows.
