title: "\"type\" is a required property - \"tools.0\""

## Reason

The error message `"type" is a required property - "tools.0"` indicates a validation failure in an OpenAI API request, specifically within the `tools` array. The API expects each object in this array to have a defined structure, and it found that the first element (index 0) is missing the mandatory `type` field.

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Missing Tool Type Definition**: When utilizing the Chat Completions API with tools, every entry in the `tools` array must explicitly state its type. Currently, the most common valid value is `"type": "function"`.
2. **Incorrect JSON Schema**: The JSON schema defined for a function or tool may be invalid. For instance, OpenAI's API requires specific properties to be defined for a schema to be considered valid; if a required field is missing from the function's parameter definition, it can trigger a 400 Validation error.
3. **Invalid or Missing API Keys and Headers**: The request may lack a valid API key or have an incorrectly formatted `Authorization` header, preventing the API from processing the request structure correctly.
4. **Invalid Request Parameters**: The request might include parameters or model-specific features (like specific dimensions) that are unsupported by the chosen model.
5. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: The request might be rejected if the account has exceeded its allocated rate limits or usage quotas.
6. **Middleware and Network Issues**: Intermediary tools or HTTP clients like Axios might misconfigure the request body or strip necessary fields during transmission.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error related to the missing `type` property in the OpenAI API, follow these steps:
1. **Explicitly Define the Tool Type**
Ensure that every object inside your `tools` array includes the `type` property. For function calling, the structure should look like this:

```json
"tools": [
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": { "name": "my_function", ... }
  }
]
```
2. **Validate the JSON Schema**
Review the `parameters` section of your function definition. Ensure it adheres to the JSON Schema standard and includes all required properties expected by the OpenAI API.
3. **Check API Key and Headers**
Verify that your API key is active and correctly passed in the headers. The header should be formatted as:
`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`.
4. **Verify Request Parameters**
Ensure that the parameters passed in the API call are supported by the specific model version you are using. Consult the OpenAI documentation to confirm model compatibility with the `tools` parameter.
5. **Manage Rate Limits**
Check your usage dashboard to ensure you have not hit your rate limits. If necessary, implement exponential backoff or request a limit increase to avoid throttling errors.
6. **Inspect Middleware Configuration**
If you are using Axios, Fetch, or a custom proxy, log the raw request body right before it is sent to OpenAI. This ensures that your code or middleware is not accidentally removing the `type` property or malforming the JSON payload.
