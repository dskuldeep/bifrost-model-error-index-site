## Reason

The 400 Bad Request error occurs when the Together AI API receives image data for a model that lacks multi-modal capabilities. This is primarily caused by:

**Incorrect Model Type Selection**
Together AI categorizes models into specific types. If you attempt to send image inputs (base64 encoded strings or image URLs) to a standard Large Language Model (LLM) designed only for text, the API will reject the request because the target model lacks the vision encoder required to process visual data.

**Data Schema Violations**
Vision-capable models expect a specific request schema where the `messages.content` field is an array of objects (containing `type: "text"` and `type: "image_url"`). Standard text models expect the `content` field to be a simple string. Sending the complex array structure used for vision tasks to a text-only model results in a schema validation failure.

## Solution
To resolve this error, ensure your request configuration matches the capabilities of the selected model by following these steps:
1. **Select a Vision-Compatible Model**: Ensure you are using a model explicitly identified as a vision model (VLM). Examples on Together AI include `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct-Turbo` or `google/paligemma-3b-pt-224`.
2. **Review API Documentation**: Consult the Together AI Model Library to verify the specific input requirements and supported modalities for your chosen model.
3. **Sanitize Inputs for Text Models**: If you intend to use a text-only model (such as Llama-3-70b), remove all image-related fields and content from your request payload.
4. **Verify Payload Structure**: Ensure that if you are using a vision model, your JSON payload follows the multi-modal format:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" },
        { "type": "image_url", "image_url": { "url": "..." } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
