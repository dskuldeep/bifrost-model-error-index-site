## Reason

The OpenAI API returns a 400 status error when a request exceeds the model's hard limit for the context window. Every model has a specific maximum context length, which represents the total number of tokens that can be processed in a single interaction. This error occurs due to the following factors:
1. Context Length Limitation: Each model has a fixed ceiling for total tokens. This total includes both the input messages (the prompt) and the tokens generated in the response (the completion).
2. Token Count Calculation: The error is triggered when the sum of the input tokens and the requested completion tokens exceeds the allowed limit. For older models, this limit is often 4,097 tokens. If messages contain 3,927 tokens and the completion is set to 1,000 tokens, the total (4,927) will exceed the capacity and cause the API to reject the request.
3. Reservation of Space: The `max_tokens` parameter acts as a reservation. Even if the model does not eventually use all the requested tokens, the API uses that value to determine if the total request will fit within the context window.

## Solution
To resolve the context length error, you must reduce the total token count to ensure it stays within the model's supported limits. Follow these remediation steps:
1. Reduce Input Messages: Shorten the message history or input text. Trim older parts of the conversation or remove non-essential context to fit the necessary information into a smaller token footprint.
2. Lower Completion Tokens: Decrease the value of the `max_tokens` (or `max_completion_tokens`) parameter. Lowering this value creates more room for the input tokens, though it may result in a shorter or truncated response.
3. Optimize the Prompt: Refine and condense your instructions. Use more concise language to convey the same context to the model using fewer tokens.
4. Split Requests: For very long inputs, implement a 'chunking' strategy. Divide the request into several smaller prompts, process them individually, and aggregate the outputs.
5. Pre-calculate Tokens: Use the `tiktoken` library to calculate the exact token count of your messages before sending the request. This allows your application to programmatically truncate text or handle overflows before the API call is made.
