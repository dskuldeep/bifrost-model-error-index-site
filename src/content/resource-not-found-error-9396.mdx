## Reason

The "Resource not found" error with a 404 status code occurs when the Azure OpenAI API gateway cannot map the incoming request to a valid resource, deployment, or API path. This is fundamentally a routing failure caused by one of the following:

- **Incorrect API Endpoint**: The URL may be improperly formatted or use an incorrect resource name. The base URL must follow the pattern `https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com/`.
- **Deployment vs. Model Name Mismatch**: Azure OpenAI requires a custom **Deployment Name** (Deployment ID) rather than the base model name (e.g., gpt-4o). If the code specifies the model name instead of the unique ID assigned during deployment in Azure AI Foundry, the resource will not be found.
- **Invalid API Version**: Requests must include a valid `api-version` query parameter (e.g., `2024-02-15-preview`). Using an unsupported, mistyped, or deprecated version prevents the API from locating the requested logic.
- **Endpoint Path Errors**: The URL path must match the specific capability of the model. For instance, using the legacy `/completions` endpoint for a chat-optimized model that requires `/chat/completions` will trigger a 404.
- **Resource Availability and Regional Issues**: The resource may be unavailable due to service outages, or the deployment may exist in a different region than the one specified in the endpoint URL. Additionally, some next-generation features require specific preview flags to be enabled in the Azure Portal.

## Solution
To resolve the "Resource not found" error, verify your configuration using the following steps:
1. **Verify the API Endpoint and Path**:
Confirm the endpoint URL is correctly structured. A standard Chat Completion request should look like:
`https://{resource-name}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment-name}/chat/completions?api-version={version}`
Ensure there are no trailing slashes or hidden characters in the resource or deployment names.
2. **Validate the Deployment ID**:
Log in to the **Azure AI Foundry** (formerly Azure OpenAI Studio) and navigate to the **Deployments** section. Ensure the `deployment_name` in your application matches the **Deployment name** field exactly (this is case-sensitive).
3. **Confirm the API Version**:
Ensure the `api-version` parameter is present and currently supported for your region and model. You can find the correct version by clicking **View Code** in the Azure AI Studio Playground.
4. **Check Model Compatibility**:
Ensure you are calling the correct sub-path for your model type. Use `/chat/completions` for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo models, and `/completions` only for older base models or specialized instruct models.
5. **Check Resource Availability and Settings**:
Verify in the Azure Portal that the OpenAI resource state is "Succeeded." If you are using preview features like the Assistants API or `/v1/responses`, ensure any required **Preview Features** flags are enabled in the resource settings.
6. **Test via Azure AI Studio**:
Use the Playground to send a test request. If it succeeds, use the "View Code" feature to copy the exact endpoint and version string into your application to eliminate configuration typos.
