## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error occurs because the `response_schema` provided in the `GenerateContentRequest` (used for structured output) contains an invalid object definition. Specifically, the error indicates that the `logic` property within the `questions` items is defined with a `type` of `OBJECT`, but its `properties` field is empty or missing.

In the Google Gemini and Vertex AI APIs, the schema validator requires that any field declared as an `OBJECT` must explicitly define its internal structure. If an object is defined without any child properties, the API cannot validate the expected output shape, leading to a validation failure.

## Solution
To resolve this error, you must ensure that all objects within your `response_schema` are fully defined with non-empty properties. Follow these steps:
1. **Define Object Properties**: Locate the `logic` field inside the `questions` items. Add a `properties` block that defines the specific keys and data types expected within that object. For example, if `logic` should contain a step-by-step explanation, define a `reasoning_steps` property inside it.
2. **Eliminate Empty Objects**: Scan your entire schema for any other fields where `"type": "object"` is used. Ensure that every one of these fields has a corresponding `properties` object that is not empty.
3. **Verify Required Fields**: After defining the properties for the `logic` object, ensure that any mandatory keys are listed in the `required` array at the same level of the schema.
4. **Validate Schema Compatibility**: Ensure your schema adheres to the specific JSON Schema subset supported by the Google Gemini API. If you intended for a field to be a flexible or arbitrary key-value map, note that the current API implementation typically requires explicit property definitions for controlled generation.
5. **Review the Full Request**: Perform a final check of the `generation_config` to ensure all parameters match the expected types and that no other `OBJECT` or `ARRAY` fields are missing their mandatory sub-definitions (like `items` for arrays).
