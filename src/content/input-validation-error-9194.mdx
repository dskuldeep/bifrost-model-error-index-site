## Reason

The error "Invalid type for 'messages.tool_calls.function': expected an object, but got a string instead" indicates a schema validation failure within the OpenAI Chat Completions API. 

Key details regarding this error include:
1. **Data Type Mismatch**: The API expects the `function` property within the `tool_calls` array to be a structured JSON object. The error occurs because the request payload provided a string (such as just the function name) instead of that object.
2. **Schema Requirements**: In the OpenAI API, each tool call must follow a strict hierarchy. If the model or the developer provides the function name as a direct value for the `function` key (e.g., `"function": "get_weather"`), the validation fails.
3. **Request Context**: This typically happens in a **Bad Request (400)** scenario where the server cannot parse the instruction because it does not match the expected API specification for function calling.

## Solution
To resolve this error, you must ensure the `function` parameter is correctly formatted as an object within the `tool_calls` array. Follow these remediation steps:
1. **Restructure the Function Parameter**: Ensure the `function` key maps to an object containing the required fields. A valid tool call structure should look like this:

* `id`: The unique identifier for the tool call.
* `type`: Set to `"function"`.
* `function`: An object containing `name` and `arguments`.
2. **Verify Mandatory Fields**: Inside the `function` object, include:

* `name`: The string name of the function to be called.
* `arguments`: A JSON-encoded string representing the arguments for the function.
3. **Audit Request Payload**: Review the code responsible for generating or passing the `messages` array. If you are manually rebuilding a conversation history or handling a model's assistant message, ensure that the `tool_calls` are not being flattened or transformed into strings accidentally.
4. **Check for Typos**: Verify that there are no misconfigurations in the keys or structural nesting of the JSON payload. Ensure that `tool_calls` is an array of objects, and each object has a `function` key that is also an object.
