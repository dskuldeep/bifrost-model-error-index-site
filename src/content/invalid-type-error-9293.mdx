## Reason

The error **'Invalid type for messages.content.image_url: expected an object, but got a string instead'** is triggered when the Azure OpenAI API receives a request where the `image_url` field is provided as a simple string rather than the required JSON object. 

In the context of multi-modal models (such as GPT-4o or GPT-4 Turbo with Vision), the API schema for the `messages` array requires a specific structure when handling image inputs. If the `content` field is an array, each element of type `image_url` must contain a nested object. Providing the URL directly as a value to the `image_url` key violates this schema, leading to a **400 Bad Request** error. This mismatch often occurs when developers follow older or simplified string-based patterns for text-only inputs and attempt to apply them to vision-based inputs.

## Solution
To fix this error, you must ensure that the `image_url` field is formatted as a structured object containing a `url` property. Follow these steps to remediate the request:
1. Identify the message content block where the image is being passed.
2. Change the value of the `image_url` key from a string (e.g., `"image_url": "[REDACTED_URL]"`) to a JSON object (e.g., `"image_url": { "url": "[REDACTED_URL]" }`).
3. Verify that the `type` field is correctly set to `"image_url"` within that specific content item.
4. Optionally, you can include the `detail` parameter within the `image_url` object to control the image processing resolution (set to `"auto"`, `"low"`, or `"high"`).

**Correct JSON Structure Example:**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Describe this image."
        },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "[REDACTED_URL]",
            "detail": "auto"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

By ensuring the `image_url` is wrapped in an object as shown above, the request will align with the Azure OpenAI API schema requirements.
