## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error, specifically the `INVALID_ARGUMENT` status with the message `"GenerateContentRequest.contents: contents is not specified"`, indicates that the request sent to the Google Gemini/Generative AI API is missing a mandatory parameter or has an invalid structure.

Key reasons for this error include:

- **Missing Mandatory `contents` Field**: The Google AI API requires the `contents` field to be present in the `GenerateContentRequest` body. This field is the core of the request, containing the conversation history and the current prompt.
- **Incorrect Request Structure**: The structure of the JSON payload might be malformed or improperly nested. If the API cannot find the `contents` key at the expected root level of the JSON object, it treats the parameter as unspecified.
- **Argument Validation Failure**: The `INVALID_ARGUMENT` status signifies that the request failed the API's schema validation. This can occur if the `contents` field is provided but is empty, or if it does not conform to the expected array-of-objects format.

## Solution
To resolve the `400 Bad Request` and `INVALID_ARGUMENT` errors, ensure your request body is correctly structured and includes all required fields. Follow these steps:
1. **Specify the `contents` field**: Verify that the `contents` parameter is included at the top level of your JSON request. This is a non-optional field for content generation.
2. **Structure the `contents` array correctly**: The `contents` field must be an array of objects. Each object should typically contain a `role` (e.g., "user" or "model") and a `parts` array containing the actual text or data.
3. **Check the JSON structure**: Ensure the overall JSON body conforms to the expected format for the specific endpoint you are calling (e.g., `v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent`).
4. **Validate all arguments**: Ensure that all other parameters in the request, such as `generationConfig` or `safetySettings`, are valid and meet the API's technical criteria.
