## Reason

The HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error occurs because the string provided in the `tools[n].function.description` field exceeds the maximum allowable character limit. 

In the OpenAI API schema, the description field for a function is used to provide the model with context on when and how to call that specific tool. This field has a strict validation constraint of **1,024 characters**. In this specific instance, the API received a string with a length of 1,784 characters, triggering a validation failure. Because this description is part of the system prompt's overhead, OpenAI enforces these limits to manage context window efficiency and ensure schema integrity.

## Solution
To resolve the `string too long` error and ensure your API request is accepted, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Truncate the Description**: Manually review the function description and shorten it to be under the 1,024-character limit. Focus on the core purpose of the function and the specific conditions under which it should be triggered.
2. **Optimize for Conciseness**: Remove redundant language or detailed technical implementation details that the model does not need. Use clear, keyword-rich phrases that describe the function's utility.
3. **Implement Client-Side Validation**: Add logic to your application to check the length of `tools` descriptions before the request is sent. This allows you to catch and handle errors locally rather than waiting for an API rejection.
4. **Refactor Complex Functions**: If a function requires an excessively long description to be understood, consider splitting it into two or more specialized functions with simpler definitions.
5. **Review Automated Pipelines**: If your function descriptions are dynamically generated (e.g., from code docstrings), update the generation logic to enforce a maximum character count and alert developers when a description is too long.
