## Reason

The `400` Bad Request error with the message "invalid model ID" indicates that the OpenAI API does not recognize the model string provided in the request or that the model is being used in an unsupported context. 

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Model ID Not Recognized or Typo**: The model ID string may contain a typo, leading/trailing spaces, or use an incorrect casing.
2. **Model Availability and Permissions**: The specific model (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `o1-preview`) may not be available for your API key, organization, or tier. Access often depends on your usage history and account billing status.
3. **Model Deprecation**: You may be attempting to use a legacy model that has been retired, such as `text-davinci-003` or older embedding models like `text-similarity-davinci-001`.
4. **Parameter Incompatibility**: The model may not support specific parameters included in the request. A common example is using the `dimensions` parameter with older embedding models like `text-embedding-ada-002`, which do not support custom vector sizes.
5. **Endpoint Mismatch**: Using a chat model (like `gpt-3.5-turbo`) with an incompatible endpoint (like `/v1/embeddings`) or vice versa will trigger this validation error.
6. **Organization Context**: The model ID might be a fine-tuned model belonging to a different organization or project that the current API key does not have access to.
7. **Server-Side Issues**: In rare cases, intermittent API issues or temporary routing errors on OpenAI's end can cause valid model IDs to be flagged as invalid.

## Solution
To resolve the `400` status error and ensure your model ID is valid, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Verify the Model ID String**: Double-check the exact spelling against the official OpenAI Model documentation. Ensure there are no extra spaces or hidden characters in your code variables.
2. **List Available Models via API**: Use the `GET https://api.openai.com/v1/models` endpoint with your current API key to see exactly which models your account is authorized to use. If a model is missing from this list, your account does not have access to it.
3. **Check for Parameter Support**: If you are using embedding models, only `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` support the `dimensions` parameter. If you are using `text-embedding-ada-002`, remove the `dimensions` field from your JSON payload.
4. **Review Deprecation Timelines**: Consult the OpenAI Deprecation guide to ensure the model has not been retired. If it has, migrate to the recommended replacement (e.g., move from `text-davinci-003` to `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`).
5. **Inspect API Key and Permissions**: Ensure your API key is active and associated with the correct organization. If you have multiple organizations, verify the `OpenAI-Organization` header is set correctly in your request.
6. **Monitor Billing and Quotas**: Verify that your account has sufficient prepaid credits and that you have not exceeded your monthly usage limit, as some models are restricted until certain billing milestones are met.
7. **Check OpenAI Service Status**: Visit the official OpenAI Status page to confirm there are no ongoing API outages or degradations affecting model routing.
8. **Validate JSON Payload**: Ensure your request adheres to the expected format for the specific endpoint you are calling, including required headers like `Content-Type: application/json`.
