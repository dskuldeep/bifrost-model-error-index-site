## Reason

The OpenAI API error `'json' is not of type 'object' - 'response_format'` occurs when the `response_format` parameter is incorrectly passed as a string (e.g., `"response_format": "json"`) instead of a structured JSON object. According to the OpenAI API specification, this field must be an object containing a `type` key.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Incorrect Parameter Syntax**: The API expects `{"type": "json_object"}` or `{"type": "json_schema", ...}`. Providing a simple string like `"json"` triggers a schema validation failure.
2. **Model Incompatibility**: The `json_object` format is only supported on specific models, such as `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` or later. Attempting to use this parameter with older models will result in a `400 Bad Request` error.
3. **Missing Prompt Requirements**: When using JSON mode, the API requires that the word "json" be explicitly mentioned in the system or user prompt. If the prompt is missing this keyword, the API may reject the request even if the formatting is technically correct.
4. **Invalid Request Body Structure**: The error can also stem from extra fields in the request body that are not permitted for the specific endpoint or a mismatch in the expected JSON structure when using SDKs or HTTP libraries.

## Solution
To resolve the `400` status error and correctly implement the `response_format` parameter, follow these steps:
1. **Correct the Response Format Syntax**: Ensure the `response_format` is passed as an object. For standard JSON mode, use:
   `"response_format": { "type": "json_object" }`.
2. **Update the Prompt**: You must include the word "json" somewhere in your prompt (system or user message) to instruct the model to produce a valid JSON string.
3. **Verify Model Compatibility**: Confirm that your request is targeting a compatible model. Supported models include:
   * `gpt-4o` and `gpt-4o-mini`
   * `gpt-4-turbo` (and `gpt-4-1106-preview`)
   * `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`
4. **Validate the Request Payload**: Ensure your JSON payload is well-formed and does not include deprecated or unsupported fields. If you are using Structured Outputs, use the `json_schema` type with the appropriate `schema` and `strict: true` parameters.
5. **Remove Extra Fields**: Review your API call to ensure no additional, non-permitted fields are being sent in the request body which might interfere with schema validation.
