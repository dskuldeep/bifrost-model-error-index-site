title: "The model `command-xl` does not exist or you do not have access to it."
provider: "openai"
provider_icon: "/logos/openai.svg"
solved: true
slug: "model-access-error-9335"
---

## Reason

The 404 status error occurs when the OpenAI API cannot locate the requested model resource. Key reasons for this failure include:

*   **Model Mismatch or Non-Existence**: The model identifier `command-xl` is not a valid OpenAI model name. This specific model is part of the Cohere model family. Attempting to call a Cohere model via an OpenAI-specific API endpoint will result in a "Resource Not Found" error.
*   **Access Restrictions**: You may lack the necessary permissions to use the requested model. While API keys are generally broad, project-specific restrictions or organization-level limitations in the OpenAI platform settings can block access.
*   **Endpoint or Parameter Issues**: The error can be triggered by using incorrect endpoint URLs or malformed parameters that prevent the server from correctly identifying the resource.
*   **Resource Not Found**: A general failure where the requested model is not found on the server, indicating a discrepancy between the model requested in the code and the models available to your specific account tier.

## Solution
To resolve the 404 error and regain access to your desired models, follow these steps:
1.  **Verify Model Existence and Provider**: Ensure that the model name is valid for the provider you are targeting. If you require `command-xl`, you must use the Cohere API. If you are using the OpenAI API, replace the model name with a supported identifier like `gpt-4o` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
2.  **Check Permissions and Access**: Log in to the OpenAI Dashboard to confirm that your API key has the required permissions. Ensure there are no project-specific restrictions or usage limits that exclude certain models.
3.  **Review Endpoint and Parameters**: Double-check the base URL and the construction of your API request. Ensure you are not pointing to a legacy or incorrect endpoint.
4.  **Update API Version or Model Selection**: If a model has been deprecated or is unavailable for your subscription tier, update your integration to use the latest available models.
5.  **Ensure Billing Details**: Verify that your account has an active billing method and a positive credit balance. Access to many high-performance models is restricted until the account moves beyond the free trial or initial usage tiers.
