## Reason

The 400 Bad Request error occurs because the total token count—representing the sum of the prompt and the requested completion—exceeds the model's architectural or API-enforced limit. In this specific case, the limit is **4097 tokens**.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Token Limit Breach**: The Together AI API calculates the combined total of `inputs` (the tokens in your prompt) and `max_new_tokens` (the maximum length of the generated response). Here, the sum is 5141 (5013 + 128), which is significantly higher than the allowed 4097.
2. **Context Window Constraints**: Many models, particularly those based on the Llama-2 architecture, have a native context window of 4096 tokens. The additional token usually accounts for the sequence-start or sequence-end markers.
3. **Schema Validation**: This error is a hard validation check performed by the API gateway to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure the request stays within the model's operational capacity.

## Solution
To resolve this input validation error, you must reduce the total token count to 4097 or fewer. Follow these remediation steps:
1. **Summarize or Truncate Input**: Review the `inputs` text and remove non-essential information. Truncate long contexts or summarize them before sending the request to reduce the initial token footprint.
2. **Implement Input Chunking**: For large documents or long conversation histories, break the text into smaller, manageable chunks. Process these chunks individually and merge the outputs as needed.
3. **Optimize Prompt Engineering**: Refine your prompts to be more concise. If using few-shot prompting, reduce the number of examples provided in the input.
4. **Adjust the `max_new_tokens` Parameter**: Lower the value of `max_new_tokens`. If your input is already near the limit, you must decrease the requested response length to accommodate the combined total.
5. **Select a Larger Context Model**: If your application requires more than 4097 tokens, consider switching to a model on Together AI with a larger context window, such as Llama-3 (8k+ tokens) or Mistral/Mixtral variants that support 32k or more tokens.
