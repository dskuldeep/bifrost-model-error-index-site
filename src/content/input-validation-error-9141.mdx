## Raw Error Text

```text
"assitant" is not one of ["system", "assistant", "user", "function"] - "messages.0.role"
```

## Reason

The **400 Bad Request** error in the Azure OpenAI API indicates that the request body failed schema validation. Specifically, the value provided for the `role` field in the `messages` array is invalid.

Azure OpenAI requires the `role` field to be one of a specific set of predefined strings. The error message `"assitant" is not one of ["system", "assistant", "user", "function"]` identifies a typographical error where "assistant" was misspelled as "assitant". The identifier `messages.0.role` pinpointed that this error occurred in the first message object (index 0) of the array.

Valid roles for the Chat Completion API include:
1.  **system**: Used to define the behavior, persona, and constraints of the model.
2.  **user**: Used for instructions or questions provided by the end-user.
3.  **assistant**: Used for previous responses generated by the model in a conversation history.
4.  **tool** or **function**: Used for providing the output of tool/function calls (depending on the API version used).

## Solution
To resolve this error, you must align the `role` values in your request payload with the API's expected format by following these steps:
1.  **Locate the invalid field**: Identify the message object mentioned in the error (e.g., `messages.0` refers to the first item in the list).
2.  **Correct the typo**: Change the value from `"assitant"` to the correct spelling: `"assistant"`.
3.  **Validate roles**: Review the entire `messages` array to ensure every object contains a valid `role` string: `"system"`, `"user"`, `"assistant"`, or `"tool"`/`"function"`.
4.  **Verify JSON structure**: Ensure the `role` value is a string and is not null or an empty sequence.
5.  **Retry the request**: Resubmit the corrected JSON payload to the Azure OpenAI endpoint.
