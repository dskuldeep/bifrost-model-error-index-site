## Raw Error Text

```text
"systemmm" is not one of ["system", "assistant", "user", "function"] - "messages.0.role"
```

## Reason

The error occurs because the `role` field in your API request contains an invalid value that does not match the OpenAI API schema. In this specific case, the value `"systemmm"` was provided, which is a misspelling of the allowed role `"system"`.

OpenAI's Chat Completions API strictly enforces that the `role` parameter within the `messages` array must be one of the following predefined strings:

- `system`: Used to provide high-level instructions or set the behavior of the assistant.
- `user`: Represents the end-user's input or prompts.
- `assistant`: Represents previous responses generated by the AI model.
- `function`: A legacy role used for reporting the results of function calls (often replaced by `tool` in newer API versions).

Because the input value does not match these accepted roles, the API server rejects the request with an **HTTP 400 Bad Request** error.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error and fix the invalid role in your OpenAI API request, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Locate the Invalid Role**: Inspect the `messages` array in your JSON request body. The error message usually specifies the exact location, such as `messages.0.role` for the first message in the list.
2. **Correct Typos**: Scan for misspellings or extra characters in the `role` value. Change erroneous strings like `"systemmm"` to the correct value, such as `"system"`.
3. **Use Supported Role Values**: Ensure that every message object in your request uses only the valid roles: `"system"`, `"user"`, `"assistant"`, or `"function"`.
4. **Verify Model Compatibility**: Be aware that certain newer models, such as `o1-mini` or `o1-preview`, may have specific constraints regarding the use of the `system` role or may require different role structures.
5. **Validate Request Formatting**: Ensure the entire payload is correctly formatted as valid JSON and adheres to the structure defined in the official OpenAI documentation.
