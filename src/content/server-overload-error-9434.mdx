## Reason

The 503 status error indicates that the OpenAI API engine is currently overloaded and cannot fulfill the request at the moment. This typically occurs due to the following factors:
1. **High Traffic Volume**: The API is experiencing a high volume of concurrent requests from multiple users, which stresses the processing power of the server infrastructure.
2. **Server Resource Limitations**: Servers may reach their allocated CPU or RAM limits, leading to an inability to handle additional tasks.
3. **Maintenance Windows**: Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance and unexpected outages can reduce the available compute capacity.
4. **Sudden Spikes in Demand**: Rapid, unpredictable increases in request rates can temporarily overwhelm the servers before auto-scaling mechanisms can compensate.

## Solution
To address the 503 'Engine Overloaded' error, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Implement Exponential Backoff**: Do not retry the request immediately. Wait for at least 5 seconds before retrying, and use an exponential backoff strategy (increasing the delay with each subsequent attempt) to avoid further straining the API.
2. **Monitor API Status**: Check the OpenAI Status Page to verify if there are any ongoing maintenance events, outages, or reported service degradations.
3. **Optimize Request Frequency**: Adjust your application to manage the rate and concurrency of API calls. Reducing the number of parallel requests can help prevent triggering overload responses during peak times.
4. **Contact OpenAI Support**: If the error persists for an extended period and the status page shows all systems are operational, contact the OpenAI Help Center for further assistance and include relevant request IDs.
