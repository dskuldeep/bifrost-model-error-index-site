## Reason

A **500 Internal Server Error** is a generic error message indicating that the Together AI server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This error is typically server-side and not directly caused by the client's input, though certain configurations can trigger it.

Key causes include:
1. **Execution Errors in Policies or Code**: Failures within the API proxy layer or internal code execution. For example, a Service Callout policy may fail if the backend server returns an unhandled 4XX or 5XX status code.
2. **Backend Server Issues**: Problems within the underlying infrastructure, such as database downtime, slow query responses, incorrect database login credentials, or data corruption.
3. **Resource Limitations**: The server or specific GPU clusters may be overloaded with high traffic or suffering from insufficient memory, CPU power, or hardware-level exhaustion.
4. **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigured server settings, such as incorrect virtual hosts, restrictive security settings, or environment-level configuration errors.
5. **Third-Party Integrations**: Failures in external services or downstream APIs that Together AI relies on to complete the request.
6. **Server Crashes**: Software bugs, unhandled exceptions, or service crashes within the Together AI stack that prevent the system from returning a successful response.

## Solution
To resolve a 500 Internal Server Error when interacting with Together AI, follow these troubleshooting and remediation steps:

**Immediate Troubleshooting**
1. **Retry the Request**: Many internal server errors are transient. Implement a retry logic with exponential backoff to see if the issue resolves itself.
2. **Monitor Server Status**: Visit the Together AI Status Page to check for active outages, GPU cluster maintenance, or known performance degradations.
3. **Verify API Key and Authentication**: Ensure your API key is valid, active, and correctly formatted in the request header (typically using the `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>` format).

**Configuration and Testing**
1. **Review API Documentation and Updates**: Confirm that you are using the latest endpoints and that your request payload follows current specifications. API updates can sometimes deprecate older configurations.
2. **Test with Different Endpoints**: Try sending a request to a different model or endpoint. If other models work, the issue may be isolated to a specific model deployment or hardware node.
3. **Review Client-Side and Server Logs**: If you have access to detailed logs, check for specific error IDs or headers (such as `x-request-id`) that can be used to track the failure.

**Escalation**
1. **Contact Support**: If the error persists beyond a reasonable timeframe, report the issue to Together AI support. Provide them with the timestamp, the model used, and any request IDs associated with the failure.
