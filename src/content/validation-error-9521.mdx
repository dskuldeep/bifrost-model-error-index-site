## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error with the message `'type' is a required property - 'tools.0'` occurs when an OpenAI API request fails schema validation. This error specifically targets the `tools` parameter in the request body.

Key reasons for this error include:
1.  **Missing Required Property**: The API request includes a `tools` array, but the first object in that array (index 0) is missing the mandatory `type` property. According to the OpenAI schema, every tool must explicitly declare its type.
2.  **Invalid Request Structure**: The tool definition does not conform to the expected JSON structure. Even if the function details are provided, the API cannot process the tool without the top-level `type` identifier.
3.  **API Documentation Non-Compliance**: The request fails to adhere to the Chat Completions API specification, which requires each tool to be an object containing both a `type` (currently only `"function"` is supported) and the corresponding tool definition (e.g., the `function` object).

## Solution
To resolve the `'type' is a required property - 'tools.0'` error, you must ensure your request payload aligns with the OpenAI tool-calling schema. Follow these remediation steps:
1.  **Add the Type Property**: Explicitly include the `"type": "function"` key-value pair for every tool defined in your `tools` array.
2.  **Correct the Tool Object Format**: Ensure each item in the `tools` list follows this structure:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "your_function_name",
    "parameters": { ... }
  }
}
```
3.  **Verify Mandatory Fields**: Check that all required fields within the `function` object, such as `name`, are present and correctly named.
4.  **Audit the Tools Array**: The error suffix `tools.0` identifies the first element as the source of the failure. Inspect the first element specifically, but ensure all subsequent tools in the array also contain the `type` property.
5.  **Review Payload for Typos**: Double-check for casing issues (e.g., using `Type` instead of `type`) or misplaced braces that might cause the `type` property to be nested incorrectly.
6.  **Consult Official Documentation**: Reference the OpenAI API documentation to ensure you are using the correct schema for the model version you are targeting.
