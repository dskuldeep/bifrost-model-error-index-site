## Reason

The 404 error with the message "tools is not supported in this model" occurs because of an incompatibility between the OpenAI model being called and the API parameters included in the request. The `tools` parameter is part of the newer function calling infrastructure, and older or deprecated model versions do not recognize this parameter or the associated endpoint logic.

Key details regarding this error include:
1. Model Capabilities: Not all models support the `tools` array. For example, legacy versions such as `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301` or models restricted to the `/v1/completions` endpoint cannot process tool-based requests.
2. Endpoint Mismatch: This error frequently arises when a user attempts to use chat-based parameters (like `tools` or `messages`) with a completions endpoint, or when using an outdated SDK version that defaults to an incompatible model.
3. Account Status: This issue is strictly related to technical compatibility and is not caused by account permissions, API key validity, or billing limitations.
4. Documentation Directives: The error explicitly indicates that the specific model name provided in the request body lacks the capability to handle the requested function, requiring a shift to a supported model version.

## Solution
To resolve the 404 error and successfully implement tool use or function calling, follow these steps:
1. Verify Model Compatibility: Refer to the official OpenAI documentation to ensure your selected model supports function calling. Generally, models released after November 2023 (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4o`) are required for the `tools` parameter.
2. Update the Model Name: Change the `model` parameter in your API request to a compatible version. For gpt-3.5, use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` or the generic `gpt-3.5-turbo` alias. For gpt-4, use `gpt-4-turbo` or `gpt-4o`.
3. Check the API Endpoint: Ensure you are sending requests to the Chat Completions endpoint (`https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`) rather than the legacy Completions endpoint, as `tools` is only supported in the Chat API.
4. Revert to Legacy Parameters (Optional): If you must use an older model that does not support `tools`, you may need to use the deprecated `functions` parameter instead, though upgrading the model is the recommended long-term solution.
5. Validate API Request Structure: Ensure that if you are using the `tools` parameter, your code correctly defines the tool type (e.g., `"type": "function"`) as required by the latest API schema.
