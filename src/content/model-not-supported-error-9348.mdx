## Reason

The 404 status error occurs because the Google Generative AI API cannot locate the specific model identifier `models/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-121` within the `v1beta` environment, or the model is not configured to support the `generateContent` method. 

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Incorrect Model Identifier**: The specified model name may be misspelled or incorrectly formatted. Experimental models often use specific date-based suffixes (e.g., `1219` for December 19th) that must match the API's registry exactly.
2. **API Version Mismatch**: The model might not be registered under the `v1beta` version of the API, or it may have been moved to the stable `v1` version.
3. **Method Incompatibility**: Even if the model exists, it may not support the `generateContent` method. Some models are specialized for embeddings or specific experimental tasks.
4. **Model Deprecation**: Since `-exp` models are experimental, they are subject to frequent updates and deprecation. If a specific snapshot like `121` is removed or replaced by a newer version, the API will return a 404 Not Found error.

## Solution
To resolve the 404 error when using the `models/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-121` model, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Call ListModels**: Use the `ListModels` method to retrieve a real-time list of all models accessible via your API key. This will provide the exact string required for the `model` parameter.
   - Endpoint: `GET [REDACTED_URL]
2. **Verify Method Support**: Examine the `supportedGenerationMethods` field in the `ListModels` response for the specific model. Ensure that `generateContent` is listed as a supported method.
3. **Validate API Version**: Check if the model is available in the `v1beta` version. If the model is not found there, try switching your endpoint to the stable version (`v1`) or check if a newer experimental version has been released.
4. **Use a Supported Model**: If the specific version `121` is no longer listed, update your implementation to use a supported variant, such as the base `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp` or a stable model like `gemini-1.5-flash`.
5. **Check Release Notes**: Consult the official Google AI documentation for the latest updates on experimental model availability and naming conventions to ensure your application is targeting current endpoints.
