## Reason

The 404 or 400 error occurs due to a mismatch between the AI model and the API endpoint. OpenAI provides two primary interfaces for text generation that are not interchangeable:
1. **Incorrect Endpoint for Non-Chat Models**: The error specifically indicates you are attempting to use the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with a model that is not built for chat (e.g., `davinci-002`, `babbage-002`, or `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`). These models require the legacy `/v1/completions` endpoint.
2. **Model Compatibility**: Chat models such as `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo` are designed for multi-turn conversations and require the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. They are incompatible with the legacy `/v1/completions` path.
3. **Payload Structure Differences**: The `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint expects a `messages` array containing role-based objects (system, user, assistant), whereas the `/v1/completions` endpoint expects a single string `prompt`. Sending a completion-style request to a chat endpoint (or vice versa) results in a failure because the API cannot parse the model's instructions through the wrong interface.

## Solution
To resolve this error, you must align your model selection with the corresponding API endpoint and request format:
1. **Identify the Model Type**:
   - Use **Chat Models** for conversational tasks. Supported models include `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
   - Use **Legacy/Instruct Models** for simple text completion. Supported models include `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`, `davinci-002`, and `babbage-002`.
2. **Select the Correct Endpoint**:
   - For Chat models, use: `[REDACTED_URL]
   - For Legacy/Instruct models, use: `[REDACTED_URL]
3. **Format Your Request Body**:
   - **Chat Endpoint**: Ensure your JSON body includes a `"messages": [...]` array.
   - **Completions Endpoint**: Ensure your JSON body includes a `"prompt": "..."` string.
4. **Verify Technical Identifiers**: Check your code for typos in the model name and ensure you are not using deprecated identifiers like `text-davinci-003`, which have been retired in favor of the newer endpoints.
