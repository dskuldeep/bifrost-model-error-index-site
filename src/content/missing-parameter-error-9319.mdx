## Reason

The OpenAI API error `Missing required parameter: 'tools[0].type'` occurs because the `tools` parameter in Chat Completions requires a specific object structure for each item in the array. This error specifically highlights that the first element (`index 0`) in your tools list is missing the mandatory `type` property.

Key reasons for this failure include:

* **Missing Type Property**: Every object within the `tools` array must have a `type` field. For function calling, the required value is currently `"function"`.
* **Incorrect Schema Nesting**: A common mistake is placing the `type` parameter inside the `function` definition block rather than at the top level of the tool object.
* **Legacy Format Conflicts**: You might be passing a list of raw function definitions (used in the deprecated `functions` parameter) into the newer `tools` parameter, which expects an extra layer of wrapping.
* **Malformed JSON**: Syntax errors, such as missing quotes around keys or improper braces, can cause the API validator to overlook the parameter even if it is present in the code.
* **Documentation Discrepancies**: Using outdated SDK examples or documentation where parameters like `role` or `function` were used interchangeably might result in a request that fails modern schema validation.

## Solution
To resolve the `400 Bad Request` error, ensure that each tool in your request payload is correctly wrapped and includes the mandatory `type` field. Follow these steps:
1. **Add the Type Field**: Explicitly define `"type": "function"` for every tool object in the array.
2. **Structure the Tool Correctly**: Verify that the tool object contains a top-level `type` and a separate `function` object. The correct structure should look like this:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": { ... }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
3. **Validate the JSON Payload**: Ensure your JSON is well-formed and that environment variables or dynamic objects are being correctly stringified/mapped to the API's expected data types.
4. **Update SDKs and Models**: Ensure you are using a model that supports the `tools` parameter (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`) and that your client library version is up to date with the current API specification.
5. **Check Documentation**: Review the official OpenAI API reference for the most recent requirements regarding tool definitions.
