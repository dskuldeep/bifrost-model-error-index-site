## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error with the message "Invalid value for 'content': expected a string, got null" occurs because the OpenAI API received a message object where the `content` field was explicitly set to `null`. In the Chat Completions API, the `messages` array requires each object to have a `content` property that must be a string (or an array of content parts for multi-modal models). 

Key causes for this issue include:
1. Variable Nullification: A variable intended to hold message content (such as user input or a database response) was uninitialized or cleared before being passed to the API payload.
2. Data Transformation Failures: Processing logic or application workflows might inadvertently transform a string value into `null` during serialization or while filtering conversation history.
3. Upstream Data Issues: Integrating with external tools or databases that return a `null` value when no data is found, which is then sent directly to the API without a fallback string.
4. Framework Misconfiguration: Errors in orchestration tools like LangChain or n8n where a retrieval step or memory buffer fails to produce a result, passing an empty reference to the content field.

## Solution
To resolve this error, you must ensure that every `content` field within the `messages` array is a valid string. Follow these remediation steps:

**Verify Data Integrity**
1. Inspect the Payload: Log the full JSON request body immediately before the network call to identify exactly which message object contains the `null` value.
2. Trace Variable Lifecycle: Check the flow of the variables being mapped to the `content` field to ensure they are properly initialized and never assigned a `null` value.

**Handle Null Values**
1. Sanitize Inputs: Implement a validation layer to filter out or fix message objects with invalid content before dispatching the request.
2. Use Fallback Values: If a variable could potentially be null, provide a default string (e.g., an empty string `""` or a placeholder text) to maintain schema compliance: `const content = rawValue ?? "";`.
3. Filter Invalid Messages: Use array filtering logic to remove any message objects that lack a valid string in the `content` field.

**Validate Request Payload**
1. Enforce Schema Validation: Use libraries like Pydantic (Python) or Zod/Joi (TypeScript) to define and validate the shape of your `messages` array against the OpenAI API requirements.
2. Confirm Required Fields: Ensure that all required keys for each message object, specifically `role` and `content`, are present and formatted correctly as strings.
