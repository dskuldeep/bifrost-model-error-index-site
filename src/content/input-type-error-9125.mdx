## Raw Error Text

```text
"{"role":"user","content":"What\"s a Fractal?"}" is not of type "object" - "messages.0"
```

## Reason

The 400 Bad Request error `"{"role":"user","content":"What\"s a Fractal?"}" is not of type "object" - "messages.0"` occurs when the OpenAI API expects a JSON object but receives a string instead. 

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Incorrect Data Type in Messages Array**: The `messages` field must be an array of objects. The error indicates that the first element (index 0) is being treated as a string literal rather than a structured object. This often happens if an individual message object is stringified (e.g., via `JSON.stringify()`) before being added to the messages list.
2. **Invalid JSON Payload Structure**: While the content inside the string looks like JSON, the surrounding quotes cause the API's schema validator to reject it. The API requires a native JSON object structure.
3. **Syntax and Quoting Issues**: Incorrect escaping of quotes within the content string or mismatched brackets can lead the parser to misinterpret the object as a raw string.
4. **API Requirements Mismatch**: The OpenAI Chat Completions endpoint strictly validates that every item in the `messages` array follows the dictionary format with specific keys like `role` and `content`.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error and ensure your request body is correctly formatted, follow these steps:
1. **Ensure Messages are Objects, Not Strings**: Verify that the `messages` field is an array of actual JSON objects. If you are using a programming language like JavaScript or Python, pass the message as a dictionary or object rather than a JSON-formatted string.
   * **Incorrect**: `messages: ["{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}"]` 
   * **Correct**: `messages: [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]`
2. **Remove Double Serialization**: If you are using an API client or HTTP library, ensure you are not calling a serialization function (like `JSON.stringify()`) on the individual elements of the array. Only stringify the final, complete request body once.
3. **Verify Required Fields**: Ensure each object within the `messages` array contains the mandatory `role` (e.g., "system", "user", or "assistant") and `content` fields.
4. **Check for Syntax Errors**: Use a JSON validator to check for extra brackets, missing commas, or improperly escaped characters (such as the quote in "What's a Fractal?") that might break the object structure.
5. **Align with Documentation**: Cross-reference your request structure with the official OpenAI API documentation for the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint.
