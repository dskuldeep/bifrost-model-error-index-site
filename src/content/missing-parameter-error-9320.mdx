## Reason

The error `Missing required parameter: 'messages[n].tool_calls[i].type'` indicates that the OpenAI API received an assistant message containing a `tool_calls` array where one or more objects are missing the mandatory `type` field. 

### Schema Validation Failure
In the OpenAI Chat Completions API, every tool call object within an assistant message must include a `type` property. Currently, the only supported value is `"function"`. If this property is missing or null, the API rejects the entire request.

### Incorrect Message Sequence
The error frequently occurs when the sequence of messages is disrupted. Specifically, a message with the role `tool` must always be preceded by an assistant message that contains the original `tool_calls`. If that assistant message is malformed or missing the `type` field, the subsequent tool response cannot be associated correctly.

### Serialization and State Persistence Issues
When chat histories are stored in databases or persistent storage (such as a LlamaIndex ChatStore), the `tool_calls` objects may be stripped of certain fields during serialization or deserialization. If the `type` field is not explicitly preserved when reloading the chat state, subsequent API calls will fail.

## Solution
To resolve the `Missing required parameter` error, ensure the message payload strictly adheres to the tool-calling schema requirements:

###
1. Explicitly Define Tool Call Type
Ensure that every object in the `tool_calls` array includes the `type` parameter set to `"function"`. If you are manually constructing message objects, use the following structure:

```json
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "id": "call_123",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_data",
        "arguments": "{}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

###
2. Validate Message Sequence
Verify that the conversation flow follows the required order:
1. A user message provides context.
2. The assistant responds with a `tool_calls` array (containing `id`, `type`, and `function`).
3. One or more `tool` messages follow, each referencing the `tool_call_id` from the assistant's message.

###
3. Sanitize Persistent Storage
If you are loading messages from a database:
- Check the stored JSON to confirm that `type: "function"` is present.
- If using an ORM or a specific library (like LangChain or LlamaIndex), ensure that the model used for storage supports all fields of the tool call object.
- Implement a validation step to re-insert missing `type` fields before sending the payload to OpenAI.

###
4. Check Library Versions
Ensure you are using the latest versions of your AI orchestration frameworks. Older versions of some libraries had issues where they did not correctly pass the `type` parameter when converting internal message objects back to the OpenAI-compatible format.
