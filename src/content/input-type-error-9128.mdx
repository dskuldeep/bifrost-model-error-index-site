## Reason

The OpenAI API returns a 400 Bad Request error with the message `'sadasdas' is not of type 'number' - 'temperature'` when the value provided for the temperature parameter fails schema validation. This typically happens due to the following reasons:

*   **Incorrect Data Type**: The API expects a numeric value (either an integer or a float) for the `temperature` field. Passing a string like `'sadasdas'` violates the expected data type, leading to an immediate rejection of the request.
*   **Invalid Request Syntax**: The request payload contains a structural or formatting error in the `temperature` field. If your environment or SDK does not strictly enforce types, it may incorrectly wrap numeric values in quotes or pass uninitialized string variables.
*   **Model Compatibility**: While most models support the `temperature` parameter, some advanced reasoning models (such as certain versions in the o1 or GPT-5 series) may have restricted ranges or limited support for non-default values. Some models only support the default value of 1.0, and providing a value outside of specific constraints can cause processing errors.

## Solution
To resolve this error and ensure your request is processed correctly, follow these steps:
1.  **Assign a Numeric Value**: Replace the string value in the `temperature` field with a valid number. The standard range for OpenAI models is between 0 and
2. For example, use `0.5` for more focused output or `1.5` for more creative output.
2.  **Ensure Correct Syntax**: Verify that the JSON payload in your code does not wrap the numeric value in quotes. In Python, this looks like `temperature=0.7` (float) rather than `temperature="0.7"` (string).
3.  **Validate Model Support**: Confirm if the specific model you are using has unique constraints for the `temperature` parameter. Check the model-specific documentation to see if it supports the value you have selected.

**Key Points for Implementation:**

*   Set `temperature` to a numeric value (e.g., 0.5, 1, 1.8).
*   Inspect the raw API request logs to ensure no automated processes or environment variables are injecting strings into numeric fields.
*   Confirm compatibility if you are using specialized reasoning or fine-tuned models that may expect specific sampling configurations.
