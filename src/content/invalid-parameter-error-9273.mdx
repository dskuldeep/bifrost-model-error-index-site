## Raw Error Text

```text
'1600x900' is not one of ['256x256', '512x512', '1024x1024', '1024x1792', '1792x1024'] - 'size'
```

## Reason

The HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error in the OpenAI API is triggered by an invalid value in the `size` parameter during an image generation request. 

The error message explicitly states that the requested dimensions (e.g., '1600x900') are not part of the API's allowed set. The OpenAI Image Generation API (DALL-E) enforces strict validation on image resolutions and does not support custom aspect ratios or arbitrary sizes. The server cannot process the request because the specified dimensions do not match the permitted values for the requested model version.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error, you must update your request to use one of the dimensions supported by the specific DALL-E model you are targeting. Follow these steps:
1. Use one of the supported image sizes for the DALL-E model you are using. Note that DALL-E 3 and DALL-E 2 have different available options.
2. Ensure the `size` parameter is set to one of the following valid dimensions:
   - 256x256 (Supported by DALL-E 2)
   - 512x512 (Supported by DALL-E 2)
   - 1024x1024 (Supported by DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3)
   - 1024x1792 (Supported by DALL-E 3 for vertical aspect ratio)
   - 1792x1024 (Supported by DALL-E 3 for horizontal aspect ratio)

By adjusting the image size to match these supported dimensions, you will satisfy the API validation requirements and avoid the invalid parameter error.
