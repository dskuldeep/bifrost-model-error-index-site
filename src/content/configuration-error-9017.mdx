## Reason

The 400 status error, specifically the message `Json mode is not enabled for models/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219`, indicates that the model you are targeting does not support the JSON output mode feature. 

This error occurs because the `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219` model is an experimental reasoning model designed to generate a "thinking process" or chain-of-thought as part of its response. Because these thinking models focus on natural language reasoning, they are currently restricted to text-only outputs and do not support structured JSON mode (setting `response_mime_type` to `application/json`) or built-in tool usage. This is a client-side configuration issue where the request settings are incompatible with the specific capabilities of the experimental model.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error caused by enabling JSON mode on an unsupported model, you must adjust your request configuration. Follow these steps:
1. **Switch to a Supported Model**: Update your configuration to use a Gemini model that supports JSON mode and structured outputs. Recommended models include `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, or the non-thinking variant `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`.
2. **Remove JSON Mode Constraints**: If you must use the `gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp` model for its reasoning capabilities, you must disable JSON mode in your `generation_config`. Remove any `response_mime_type: "application/json"` or `response_schema` parameters from your API call.
3. **Verify Model Compatibility**: Before implementing structured outputs, ensure that the chosen model version is compatible with the features you are using. You can programmatically check model capabilities using the `models.get` or `models.list` methods in the Gemini API.
4. **Consult Official Documentation**: Refer to the latest Gemini API documentation to confirm the specific feature set and limitations for experimental or thinking-mode models.
