## Reason

The status error you are seeing in the Anthropic API, specifically the message "Usage blocked due to lack of credits. Please navigate to Plans and Billing to upgrade or purchase credits," indicates that your current credit balance is insufficient to make the requested API call. 

This error occurs because the Anthropic API operates on a prepaid model for most account tiers, requiring a minimum credit balance to process requests. When your balance reaches zero or falls below the threshold needed for the specific prompt and completion tokens requested, the system blocks further usage until the account is replenished.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error due to insufficient credits in the Anthropic API, you must replenish your account balance. Follow these steps to restore access:
1. Visit the Anthropic Console and log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** section in the top navigation menu.
3. Select **Plans & Billing** from the sidebar.
4. Click on **Add Funds** or **Purchase Credits** to add the desired amount to your balance.

To avoid future service interruptions, it is highly recommended to configure the following proactive measures in the same **Plans & Billing** section:

- **Enable Auto-reload:** Set a minimum balance threshold (e.g., $10) that will automatically trigger a credit purchase of a predefined amount when your balance drops.
- **Configure Usage Alerts:** Set up email notifications to receive alerts when your credit balance or monthly spend reaches specific limits.
