## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error with the message `'name' is not of type 'object' - 'functions.2'` indicates that the OpenAI API's JSON validator encountered a structural mismatch in your request payload. Specifically, the error identifies an issue with the third item (index 2) within the `functions` array.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Invalid Schema Structure**: This error often occurs when the API expects a JSON Schema object but receives a different type, such as a string or a primitive value. If you are defining function parameters, the `parameters` field must be an object representing a valid JSON Schema.
2. **Mismatched Data Types**: Values passed into the request—often via environment variables or dynamic code—might be of the incorrect type. For instance, if a field requires an object but receives a string, the validator will reject the request.
3. **Incorrect Function Definition**: In OpenAI's legacy function calling (or the `tools` API), each function must be an object. If the structure is nested incorrectly or missing required keys, the validator may report type mismatches on unexpected fields.
4. **Hidden or Invalid Characters**: Hidden characters, such as non-breaking spaces or trailing commas, can cause the JSON parser to misinterpret the structure of the request body.
5. **API Configuration Issues**: General configuration errors, including malformed headers or incorrect base URLs, can prevent the API from correctly parsing the intended JSON payload.

## Solution
To resolve the `400` status error and ensure your API calls are formatted correctly, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Verify API Keys and Organization ID**: Confirm that your API key and Organization ID are correct, active, and included in the request headers.
2. **Validate JSON Payload Structure**: Ensure the request body is valid JSON. Specifically, inspect the `functions` (or `tools`) array at index
2. Verify that the `parameters` field is a properly formatted JSON Schema object and not a string.
3. **Inspect Request Parameters**: Compare your payload against the official OpenAI API reference. Ensure all field names are spelled correctly and that values strictly match the expected types (e.g., ensuring `name` is a string and `parameters` is an object).
4. **Check for Hidden or Invalid Characters**: Sanitize your request payload and environment files to remove any hidden characters, unexpected whitespace, or invalid symbols that could break JSON parsing.
5. **Correct Headers and Base URL**: Verify that the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` and that the `Authorization` header uses the correct `Bearer` token format.
6. **Test with Debugging Tools**: Use a tool like Postman, Hoppscotch, or `curl` to send a raw JSON request. This helps isolate whether the error is caused by your application's serialization logic or the underlying data.
