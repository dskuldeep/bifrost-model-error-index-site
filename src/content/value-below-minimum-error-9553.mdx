## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error occurs in the OpenAI API when the `max_tokens` parameter is set to a value below the required minimum. In this instance, the value `-230` was passed, which is less than the minimum allowed value of `1`.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Invalid Parameter Value**: The `max_tokens` parameter must be a positive integer of at least `1`. Setting it to zero or a negative number violates the API requirements, leading to a "Bad Request" error.
2. **Dynamic Calculation Logic**: This error often occurs when the `max_tokens` value is calculated dynamically (e.g., subtracting the prompt length from the model's maximum context window). If the input prompt is larger than expected, the calculation can result in a negative number.
3. **Strict Validation**: The OpenAI API performs strict validation on request payloads. Any parameters that are out-of-range or improperly configured will trigger a 400 status code.

## Solution
To resolve the `400` status error due to the `max_tokens` parameter being less than `1`, ensure your request parameters are correctly configured by following these steps:
1. **Correct the max_tokens Value**: Set the `max_tokens` parameter to a value of at least `1`. If you are calculating this value programmatically, implement a floor to ensure it cannot drop below the minimum (e.g., `max(1, calculated_value)`).
2. **Verify API Key and Headers**: Ensure that your API key, base URL, and headers are accurate, up-to-date, and properly formatted in the request payload.
3. **Check Context Window Limits**: Confirm that the total token count—including both the input prompt and the `max_tokens` value—does not exceed the specific model's context window limit (e.g., 128,000 tokens for GPT-4o).
4. **Validate Request Payload Size**: Ensure the overall request size stays within allowed limits and that the JSON structure is valid.
5. **Adhere to Rate Limits**: Monitor your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits, which can cause subsequent requests to fail.
6. **Model Selection**: If your task requires a large output that frequently hits token limits, consider using a model with a larger context window or optimizing the input prompt to free up token space.
