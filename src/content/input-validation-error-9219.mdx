## Raw Error Text

```text
'useer' is not one of ['system', 'assistant', 'user', 'function'] - 'messages.1.role'
```

## Reason

The error `"useer" is not one of ['system', 'assistant', 'user', 'function'] - 'messages.1.role'` is an input validation failure, typically returning an HTTP 400 status code. This occurs because the OpenAI API expects the `role` attribute within the `messages` array to match a specific set of predefined strings.

In this specific instance, a typo was detected where the value `"useer"` was provided instead of the correct value `"user"`. The API's error message includes a path—`messages.1.role`—which indicates that the invalid value is located in the second object (index 1) of the messages array. 

Valid roles accepted by the OpenAI Chat Completions API include:
1. `system`: Used to set the behavior of the assistant.
2. `user`: Used for instructions or queries provided by the end user.
3. `assistant`: Used to represent previous responses from the model.
4. `function` (or `tool` in newer API versions): Used to provide the output of a function call back to the model.

## Solution
To resolve this validation error and fix the HTTP 400 response, you must correct the typo in your request payload. Follow these remediation steps:
1. Locate the `messages` array in your API request body.
2. Identify the specific object indexed at `1` (the second message in the list).
3. Correct the typo by changing the `role` value from `"useer"` to `"user"`.
4. Verify that all other message objects in the array use one of the permitted roles: `"system"`, `"user"`, `"assistant"`, or `"function"` (or `"tool"` / `"developer"` depending on the specific model and API version being used).
5. Double-check that all other parameters, such as `content` or `name`, are correctly formatted and that all required headers (like `Authorization` and `Content-Type`) are present.
