## Raw Error Text

```text
We could not parse the JSON body of your request. (HINT: This likely means you aren"t using your HTTP library correctly. The OpenAI API expects a JSON payload, but what was sent was not valid JSON. If you have trouble figuring out how to fix this, please contact us through our help center at help.openai.com.)
```

## Reason

The "We could not parse the JSON body of your request" error, typically accompanied by an HTTP 400 status code, indicates that the OpenAI API server received a request payload that does not conform to standard JSON syntax.

Key causes include:
1.  **Invalid JSON Syntax**: The payload contains structural errors such as missing or mismatched quotes, brackets, or braces. A common issue is the inclusion of trailing commas after the last item in an array or object, which standard JSON parsers reject.
2.  **Incorrect HTTP Library Usage**: The HTTP client may be sending the data in an unexpected format (such as `multipart/form-data` or a raw byte stream) instead of a serialized JSON string. This often happens if the library's automatic serialization is misconfigured.
3.  **Missing or Incorrect Headers**: If the `Content-Type` header is not set to `application/json`, the API may fail to interpret the request body correctly.
4.  **Encoding and Character Issues**: The request may contain unescaped control characters or may not be encoded in UTF-8, which is required by the OpenAI API.
5.  **Data Type Mismatches**: Providing data structures or types that the specific endpoint does not expect (e.g., sending an object where an array is required) can lead to parsing failures during the schema validation phase.

## Solution
To resolve the JSON parsing error, follow these remediation steps to ensure your request is properly formatted and compliant with OpenAI's requirements:
1.  **Validate JSON Structure**: Use a tool like `JSONLint` or a similar validator to check your payload for syntax errors. Ensure that all keys are double-quoted and that there are no trailing commas.
2.  **Verify Content-Type Headers**: Ensure your HTTP request includes the header `Content-Type: application/json`. This informs the server to treat the body as a JSON payload.
3.  **Serialize Data Correctly**: Do not pass native language objects (like Python dictionaries or JavaScript objects) directly into the request body. Use standard serialization methods:
    *   In JavaScript: `JSON.stringify(payload)`
    *   In Python: `json.dumps(payload)`
4.  **Escape Special Characters**: If your payload includes dynamic content like user prompts, ensure that newlines (`\n`), tabs, and double quotes within the string are properly escaped.
5.  **Debug with Pretty-Printing**: Use `JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)` (JavaScript) or `json.dumps(obj, indent=2)` (Python) to print and inspect the final payload for typos or structural anomalies before it is sent.
6.  **Test with Postman or cURL**: Replicate the request in a tool like Postman. If the request succeeds there but fails in your code, the issue is likely rooted in your HTTP library's configuration or serialization logic.
