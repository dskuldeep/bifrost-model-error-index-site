## Reason

This error occurs when the OpenAI or Azure OpenAI safety systems detect that a request violates established safety and usage guidelines. Key reasons for the rejection include:
1. **Content Filtering**: The request may contain text or images that trigger automated filters for prohibited categories. These categories include hate speech, harassment, self-harm, sexual content, and graphic violence.
2. **Policy Violations**: The input may trigger specific content management policies. For Azure OpenAI users, this includes **Prompt Shields** for detecting jailbreak attempts and filters for **Protected Material** (such as copyrighted code or text).
3. **Restricted Topics**: Requests involving public figures, politicians, or sensitive personal identifiable information (PII) are often blocked to prevent misuse and maintain responsible AI standards.
4. **Invalid or Non-Compliant Input**: The request might be flagged if it contains invalid characters, incorrect data types, or syntax errors that make the prompt non-compliant with the API's configuration requirements.

## Solution
To resolve the safety system rejection and prevent future 400 status errors, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Review and Modify Prompts**: Audit your prompts for sensitive keywords or instructions that could be misinterpreted as harmful. Use neutral, specific phrasing. For example, instead of broad summaries, specify the neutral context of the content being processed.
2. **Implement the Moderation API**: Use the OpenAI Moderation endpoint (`/v1/moderations`) as a pre-flight check. This free tool allows you to identify if content violates safety standards before sending it to more expensive completion models.
3. **Validate Input Syntax**: Verify that the prompt is properly formatted and complies with the API's technical syntax and configuration requirements, including character limits and header standards.
4. **Adjust Content Filter Severity**: If using Azure OpenAI, navigate to the **Content Filters** tab in Azure OpenAI Studio. You may be able to adjust the severity sliders (Low, Medium, High) or apply for modified filtering if your specific use case involves safe but sensitive content.
5. **Preprocess Sensitive Data**: If your inputs contain ambiguous phrasing or sensitive identifiers, preprocess the text to mask or remove elements that might trigger a policy flag.
