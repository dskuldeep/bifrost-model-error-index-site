## Reason

The 400 Bad Request error `"content" is a required property - "messages.0"` indicates that the Azure OpenAI API request is malformed because the first object (index 0) in the `messages` array is missing the mandatory `content` field.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Missing Mandatory Property**: The `messages` array expects a list of objects where each object must contain both `role` and `content`. This error specifically highlights that the very first message in your list does not have a `content` key.
2. **Incorrect Request Structure**: The payload may not follow the Chat Completions schema. For example, if you send a raw string instead of an array of objects, or if the `messages` array is empty, the validator will fail at the first expected element.
3. **Empty or Invalid Content**: Some API versions or specific model endpoints (like earlier GPT-3.5 versions) may reject a `content` field that is an empty string (`""`) or a null value, treating it as a missing required property.
4. **Data Type Mismatch**: The API expects the `content` property to be a string (or a specific array of objects for multi-modal models like GPT-4o). Providing an unsupported type (e.g., an integer or a nested object that doesn't match the schema) can trigger validation errors.

## Solution
To resolve this error, ensure your API request payload strictly adheres to the Azure OpenAI Chat Completions schema.
1. **Verify the `messages` Array**: Open your request body and locate the `messages` field. Ensure it is a JSON array: `"messages": [...]`.
2. **Explicitly Include the `content` Key**: For every object in the `messages` array, verify the presence of the `content` property. A valid first message should look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "system",
     "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
   }
   ```
3. **Check for Empty Strings**: If you are dynamically generating the prompt, ensure the variable assigned to `content` is not an empty string or `null`. If the content is optional for your logic, provide a placeholder string or a space (`" "`) if the API requires a non-zero length.
4. **Review Object Nesting**: Ensure you are not accidentally nesting the `content` property inside another object unless you are using multi-modal inputs (e.g., images), in which case the structure must match the `type: "text"` or `type: "image_url"` schema exactly.
5. **Test with a Minimal Payload**: Use a tool like Postman or `curl` to send a simplified request with a single message to confirm your endpoint and API key are working correctly before re-introducing complex message logic.
