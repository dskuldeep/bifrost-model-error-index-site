## Reason

The error `"json_object" is not of type "object" - "response_format"` with an HTTP 400 status code indicates that the OpenAI API received an invalid data type for the `response_format` parameter. 

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Parameter Type Mismatch**: The API expects `response_format` to be a JSON object (e.g., `{"type": "json_object"}`), but the request is likely providing a string (e.g., `"response_format": "json_object"`). This mismatch triggers a validation error.
2. **Invalid Request Syntax**: The request body is malformed or uses incorrect syntax that does not align with the API's schema requirements.
3. **Configuration Issues**: Improperly constructed request headers or parameters that do not match the expected API structure, leading to a "Bad Request" response.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error related to the `response_format` parameter, follow these steps:

**1. Correct the Parameter Syntax**
Ensure that `response_format` is passed as a structured object rather than a string. The correct format for enabling JSON mode is:
`"response_format": { "type": "json_object" }` 

**2. Include a Mandatory Prompt Instruction**
When using `json_object`, you must also explicitly instruct the model to generate JSON in your system or user message. For example: 
`"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to output JSON."}]` 

**3. Use a Supported Model**
Verify that the model you are calling supports the `json_object` format. This feature is typically available in models such as `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` or later. If your model does not support this format, remove the `response_format` parameter to allow the API to default to standard text.

**4. Verify Request Alignment**
Check your request structure against the official OpenAI API documentation to ensure all parameters match the expected types and structures. If specific formatting is not required, removing the `response_format` parameter entirely will resolve the type mismatch.
