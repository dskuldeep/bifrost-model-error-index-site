## Reason

The error **"You requested a model that is not compatible with this engine"** (typically accompanied by a 400 status code) indicates a structural mismatch between the requested model and the API endpoint or "engine" being used to process the request.

Key reasons for this failure include:

*   **Endpoint-Model Mismatch**: This is the most common cause. It occurs when trying to use a newer model (like `gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`) with legacy `/v1/engines` endpoints. Newer models are designed to work with specific endpoints such as `/v1/chat/completions`.
*   **Model Deprecation**: The model being requested may have been deprecated or officially retired by OpenAI, making it no longer compatible with active processing engines.
*   **API Configuration Changes**: Updates to OpenAI's infrastructure may have changed how models are routed, rendering previously valid model-engine combinations invalid.
*   **Invalid API Specifications**: The combination of model and engine parameters in the request does not align with OpenAI's current technical specifications.

## Solution
To resolve the incompatibility error, you must align your API request with OpenAI's current endpoint and model architecture. Follow these steps:
1.  **Verify Model Support and Availability**: Check the OpenAI official documentation to ensure the model name (e.g., `gpt-4o`) is correct and that the model is still active and supported.
2.  **Update the API Endpoint**: Ensure you are using the correct endpoint for the specific model type:
    *   Use `/v1/chat/completions` for Chat-based models (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`).
    *   Use `/v1/completions` only for models that support legacy completion logic.
    *   Avoid the `/v1/engines/` path unless specifically required for legacy systems and confirmed to be compatible.
3.  **Check Deprecation Schedules**: If you are using older models like `text-davinci-003` or `code-davinci-002`, consult the OpenAI Deprecation guide to identify the recommended replacement model.
4.  **Update SDKs and Libraries**: If you are using a client library (like the OpenAI Python or Node.js packages), ensure it is updated to the latest version. Older library versions may default to outdated engine paths.
5.  **Review API Documentation**: Ensure your request structure follows the latest API reference for model and engine combinations.
6.  **Contact OpenAI Support**: If the model and endpoint are confirmed to be correct but the error persists, contact the OpenAI Help Center at help.openai.com for further assistance.
