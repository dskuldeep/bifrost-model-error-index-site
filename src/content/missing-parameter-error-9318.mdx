## Reason

The "Missing required parameter: 'response_format.json_schema'" error in the Azure OpenAI API occurs because the API request specifies a response type that requires a schema definition, but fails to provide it. 

Key reasons for this error include:

- **Mandatory Parameter for Structured Outputs**: When utilizing the Structured Outputs feature, the API requires the `response_format.json_schema` parameter to understand the intended structure of the model's response. Without this parameter, the API cannot validate the output against a specific schema.
- **Incorrect Request Configuration**: The request body is incomplete. If the `type` field within `response_format` is set to `json_schema`, the `json_schema` object must be explicitly defined.
- **API Requirements**: The Azure OpenAI and OpenAI APIs enforce strict validation on these parameters to ensure that responses conform to the requested `JsonSchema` type. This error is a direct result of the API rejecting a request that lacks the schema definition required for that mode.

## Solution
To resolve the "Missing required parameter: 'response_format.json_schema'" error, you must ensure that the `response_format` object is correctly populated in your API request. 

Follow these steps to remediate the issue:
1. **Include the Missing Parameter**: Add the `json_schema` object inside the `response_format` block of your request payload.
2. **Verify Schema Formatting**: Ensure the `json_schema` object includes the mandatory fields required by the API:
   - `name`: A name for the schema (alphanumeric with underscores or hyphens).
   - `schema`: The actual JSON Schema definition describing the desired output format.
   - `strict`: Typically required to be set to `true` for Structured Outputs.
3. **Check Response Type**: If you intended to use standard JSON Mode without a strict schema, ensure the type is set to `{ "type": "json_object" }`. However, if you are using the newer Structured Outputs feature, the type must be `json_schema` and the schema object must be present.
4. **Consult Documentation**: Verify the exact structure and allowed properties for the JSON schema version you are using (e.g., ensuring `additionalProperties: false` is set for compatibility with `strict: true`).
5. **Ensure Model Compatibility**: Confirm that the model deployment being used (e.g., `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` or later) supports the `json_schema` response format.
