## Reason

This 400 Bad Request error occurs because the OpenAI API expects all values within the `metadata` object to be strings, but the value assigned to the `data` field was a different type (such as an integer, boolean, or object).

Key reasons include:
1. **Invalid Data Type**: The API validator specifically flagged `metadata -> data` with `type=type_error.str`, indicating that while a string was required, a non-string value was provided.
2. **Strict Schema Enforcement**: OpenAI enforces a strict schema for the `metadata` parameter. It does not automatically cast numbers or booleans into strings; these must be converted before the request is sent.
3. **Incorrect JSON Payload**: Discrepancies in the JSON structure, such as attempting to nest another object within the `metadata` field, will trigger validation failures as the API expects a flat key-value map.

## Solution
To resolve the validation error, ensure the request payload conforms to OpenAI's specific metadata requirements:
1. **Ensure Correct Data Types**: Convert the value for the `data` key (and all other metadata values) into a string. For example, use `str(value)` in Python or `.toString()` in JavaScript.
2. **Comply with Metadata Constraints**:
   * **Quantity**: A maximum of 16 key-value pairs are allowed per object.
   * **Key Length**: Keys must not exceed 64 characters.
   * **Value Length**: Values must not exceed 512 characters.
3. **Flatten the Metadata**: Ensure the `metadata` object contains only a single level of key-value pairs. Nested objects or arrays are not supported within metadata.
4. **Verify JSON Format and Headers**: Confirm the JSON payload is correctly formatted and that the `Content-Type: application/json` header is included. Also, verify that your `Authorization` header contains a valid API key.
5. **Review API Documentation**: Consult the OpenAI API reference for the specific endpoint you are calling (e.g., Assistants, Runs, or Files) to ensure metadata is supported for that object type.
