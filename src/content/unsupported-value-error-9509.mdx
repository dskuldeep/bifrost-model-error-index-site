## Reason

The error `Unsupported value: 'messages.role' does not support 'developer' with this model` occurs because the message configuration uses a role identifier that is incompatible with the selected OpenAI model. 

Key reasons for this failure include:
1. **Model Limitation**: The `developer` role was recently introduced by OpenAI to replace the `system` role for specific reasoning models. However, models such as `o1-preview` and `o1-mini` do not support the `developer` role in certain configurations or API versions.
2. **Invalid Role Set**: The API expects roles from a strictly defined list. If the model version is older or specifically restricted, it will reject the `developer` label.
3. **Supported Roles**: Valid roles for these models are limited to specific values. Depending on the API version and model type, recognized roles include:
   * `SYSTEM` 
   * `USER` 
   * `ASSISTANT` 
   * `FUNCTION` 
   * `TOOL` 
   * `CHATBOT` 
   * `MODEL`

## Solution
To resolve the `BadRequestError` and fix the unsupported role issue, adjust your message configuration using the following steps:
1. **Replace the Developer Role**: Change the 'developer' role to a role that the model explicitly supports. For most standard and reasoning models, you should use the `SYSTEM` role for high-level instructions.
2. **Use Valid Role Identifiers**: Ensure your message array uses one of the following supported roles:
   * `SYSTEM` 
   * `USER` 
   * `ASSISTANT` 
   * `FUNCTION` 
   * `TOOL` 
   * `CHATBOT` 
   * `MODEL`
3. **Update Client Libraries**: Ensure your OpenAI SDK (Python, Node.js, etc.) is updated to the latest version. Support for newer roles like `developer` often requires recent library updates (`pip install --upgrade openai`).
4. **Check Model-Specific Requirements**: If you are using the `o1` series, consult the documentation to see if your specific model version (e.g., `o1-preview-2024-09-12`) requires instructions to be passed via the `user` role or if it has been updated to accept `developer` instructions.
