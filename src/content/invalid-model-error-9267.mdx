## Reason

The error `Invalid model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` typically occurs when there is a mismatch between the requested model and the API provider, or when the request payload contains data types the model cannot process. 

Key reasons include:
1. **Provider and Model Mismatch**: The error indicates that the `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` model (an OpenAI identifier) is being requested from a provider that does not recognize it, such as Mistral AI. Providers only support their own specific model strings.
2. **Unsupported Content Types**: Even when used with the correct provider, this error can trigger if the request includes image message content types. The `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` model is a text-based model and does not support multi-modal (image) inputs.
3. **Bad Request (400 Status)**: A 400 error status generally signifies a malformed request. This can be caused by invalid syntax, incorrect headers, or an improperly structured data payload that the server cannot parse.
4. **Configuration Errors**: Issues such as hidden characters in environment variables, trailing spaces in API keys, or incorrect endpoint URLs can lead the gateway to misinterpret the model request.
5. **Model Availability**: The specific model version may not be available to your account tier or may have been deprecated by the provider.

## Solution
To resolve the invalid model error and associated 400 status codes, follow these steps:
1. **Verify Provider Compatibility**: Ensure that the model string you are using matches the provider's API. For example, if you are using the Mistral AI endpoint, you must use Mistral models (e.g., `mistral-tiny`, `mistral-medium`) rather than OpenAI identifiers.
2. **Check Model Availability**: Verify that `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` is active and accessible within your OpenAI account. Check the OpenAI API documentation or the Playground to confirm your account has the necessary permissions.
3. **Validate Request Content**: Ensure your request does not include `image_url` or multi-modal content blocks. If you are using a library like LangChain, ensure it is not automatically wrapping text in a format intended for vision-capable models.
4. **Audit Request Parameters**: Review the API payload for missing or invalid parameters. Ensure all required fields are present and that numerical values (like temperature or top_p) are within the allowed ranges.
5. **Confirm API Credentials**: Verify that your API keys and headers are correctly set in your environment variables. Ensure there are no hidden formatting characters or white spaces.
6. **Test with a Standard Model**: Try switching to a standard, widely available model (like `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `mistral-small-latest`) to determine if the issue is specific to the versioned model string.
