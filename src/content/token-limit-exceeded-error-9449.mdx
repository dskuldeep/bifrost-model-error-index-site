## Reason

This error occurs because the value assigned to the `max_tokens` parameter exceeds the hardcoded output limit for the specific OpenAI model being called. While many modern models, such as GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4o, possess expansive context windows (e.g., 128,000 tokens) for processing input, they still maintain a separate, smaller limit for the completion (output) phase.

Key aspects of this limitation include:

*   **Completion vs. Context Window:** The `max_tokens` parameter specifically limits the number of tokens the model can generate in its response. For many legacy and current OpenAI models (like `gpt-4-turbo-preview` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`), this limit is strictly capped at 4,096 tokens.
*   **Hardcoded Constraints:** Even if your total request (prompt + completion) is well within the 128k context window, setting `max_tokens` higher than the model's specific completion limit (in this case, 4,096) will trigger a `400 Bad Request` error before the model processes the request.
*   **Model Specificity:** Different models have different caps. Newer models like the `o1` series have significantly higher completion limits, but standard GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 variants frequently enforce the 4,096 limit described in the error message.

## Solution
To resolve the "max_tokens is too large" error, you must align your request parameters with the architectural limits of the model. Follow these steps:
1.  **Adjust the max_tokens Parameter:** Lower the `max_tokens` value in your API request to 4,096 or less. If the error message specifies a different maximum (e.g., 2,048), ensure your value does not exceed that specific number.
2.  **Verify Total Context Length:** Ensure that the sum of your input tokens (prompt) and the requested `max_tokens` does not exceed the model's total context window. For example, if using a model with an 8,000-token context window and your prompt is 6,000 tokens, `max_tokens` cannot exceed 2,000.
3.  **Implement Content Management Strategies:** If your application requires responses longer than 4,096 tokens, use the following techniques:
    *   **Text Chunking:** Break large tasks into smaller, sequential API calls.
    *   **Summarization:** Summarize previous turns in a conversation to save space for new outputs.
    *   **Prompt Optimization:** Refine your instructions to encourage concise responses.
4.  **Check Model Documentation:** If you require larger outputs in a single call, consider switching to newer models like `o1-preview` or `o1-mini`, which support significantly higher completion token limits (up to 32,768 or 65,536 tokens respectively).
