## Reason

The error `1 validation error for Request query -> limit ensure this value is less than or equal to 100` occurs when a request sent to the OpenAI API violates a specific numerical constraint on the `limit` query parameter. This is typically part of a 400 Bad Request response, which indicates the server could not process the request due to client-side errors.

Key reasons for this specific validation error include:

*   **Parameter Out of Range**: Many OpenAI listing endpoints (such as those for Assistants, Files, or Vector Stores) strictly enforce a maximum value of 100 for the `limit` parameter. Setting this value higher triggers the `value_error.number.not_le` (not less than or equal to) constraint.
*   **Invalid API Keys**: An incorrect, expired, or mismatched API key can trigger a broad 400 error. It is essential to ensure the key in use matches the one in your OpenAI Developer Dashboard.
*   **Incorrect Request Syntax or Configuration**: Missing headers, malformed query strings, or improperly formatted data payloads often result in validation failures.
*   **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Exceeding established usage tiers may cause the API to reject requests with a 400 or 429 status code.
*   **Invalid Input Data**: Hidden characters, such as extra whitespace or newlines at the start or end of the input, can cause the API to fail validation.
*   **Incorrect Payload Structure**: Missing required fields (e.g., `role` and `content` in fine-tuning or chat completion data) can lead to validation errors during request parsing.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 Bad Request and specific validation error, follow these remediation steps:
1.  **Adjust the Limit Parameter**: Ensure that the `limit` value in your request query is set to an integer between 1 and 100. If your application needs to retrieve more than 100 items, implement pagination using the `after` or `before` cursors provided in the API response.
2.  **Verify API Key and Configuration**: Confirm that your API key is currently active and properly authenticated within your code or environment variables.
3.  **Inspect Request Syntax and Payload**: Double-check that your request headers (e.g., `Authorization`, `OpenAI-Organization`) and JSON payload structure strictly follow the official API documentation for the specific endpoint being called.
4.  **Adhere to Rate Limits**: Monitor your usage in the OpenAI dashboard to ensure you are not exceeding your organization's rate limits. If necessary, implement exponential backoff in your request logic.
5.  **Clean Input Data**: Sanitize all input strings by removing leading or trailing whitespace and ensuring that all parameters are within their documented allowed ranges.
