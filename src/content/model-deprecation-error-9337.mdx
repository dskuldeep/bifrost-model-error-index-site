## Reason

The 404 status error (Model Not Found) is caused by the deprecation of the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model. 

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Deprecation Timeline**: On June 6, 2024, OpenAI announced that `gpt-4-vision-preview` and `gpt-4-32k` would be deprecated.
2. **Access Restrictions**: Effective June 17, 2024, these models were restricted. New API users do not have access to these identifiers, and existing users are required to migrate to newer versions.
3. **Model Non-Existence**: The error indicates that the model identifier `gpt-4-vision-preview` is no longer recognized as a valid endpoint or resource for your specific API key/organization context due to its retired status.
4. **Tier-Based Access**: Access to certain legacy or preview models is often restricted based on the API usage tier (e.g., Tier 1 vs. Tier 5), and deprecated models are the first to be removed from lower-tier access.

## Solution
To resolve the 404 error and restore functionality, follow these remediation steps:
1. **Migrate to a Supported Model**: Update your code to use a current model with vision capabilities. OpenAI recommends switching to `gpt-4o` (Omni) or `gpt-4-turbo`. `gpt-4o` is generally preferred as it is faster and more cost-effective while maintaining high performance for vision tasks.
2. **Update API Parameters**: When switching to `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4-turbo`, ensure your payload follows the standard Chat Completions format. For vision tasks, ensure the image data is provided in the `messages` array using the `image_url` type.
3. **Verify API Key Permissions**: Visit the OpenAI Dashboard and check your project settings to ensure the replacement model (e.g., `gpt-4o`) is enabled for your API key.
4. **Check Billing Status**: Ensure your account has a positive credit balance. Access to newer, high-performance models may be restricted if the account is not in a paid tier or has reached its usage limit.
5. **Update Client Libraries**: Run the appropriate update command (e.g., `pip install --upgrade openai` for Python or `npm install openai@latest` for Node.js) to ensure your environment supports the latest model definitions and endpoint configurations.
