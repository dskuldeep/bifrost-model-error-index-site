## Reason

The 400 "Bad Request" error in the OpenAI API indicates that the server cannot process the request due to a client-side validation failure. Specifically, the error message `'messages' is a required property` identifies a missing mandatory parameter in the request payload.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Missing Required Properties**: In OpenAI Chat Completion requests, the `messages` field is mandatory and must be an array of message objects. If this key is missing, empty, or misspelled (e.g., using `message` instead of `messages`), the request will fail.
2. **Invalid Syntax or Configuration**: The request body may contain malformed JSON, incorrect data types, or invalid API headers that prevent the server from parsing the data correctly.
3. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: While usually resulting in a 429 status, exceeding specific usage tiers or hitting rapid-fire limits can sometimes trigger a 400 error in certain network configurations or middleware environments.
4. **Model-Specific Constraints**: Certain parameters are only valid for specific models. For instance, providing a `dimensions` parameter for a model that does not support it will trigger an invalid request error.
5. **Header Limitations**: OpenAI may impose restrictions on the number or size of headers. Including an excessive number of custom headers or overly large headers can lead to a 400 Bad Request response.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 status error, ensure your request adheres to the OpenAI API specification by following these steps:
1. **Include Required Properties**: Verify that the `messages` property is included in the request body for Chat Completion endpoints. The value must be an array of objects (e.g., `[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]`).
2. **Verify API Keys and Headers**: Check that your API key is valid, active, and correctly passed in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer {API_KEY}` format.
3. **Check Request Syntax and Configuration**: Ensure the payload is valid JSON and that all field names and data types match the expected schema defined in the official API reference.
4. **Adhere to Rate Limits**: Monitor your token and request usage. If you are hitting limits, implement an exponential backoff strategy or request a quota increase through the OpenAI dashboard.
5. **Comply with Model-Specific Constraints**: Review the requirements for the specific model you are calling. Ensure parameters like `temperature`, `top_p`, or `max_tokens` are within the allowed ranges for that model.
6. **Inspect Network Traffic**: Use a tool like Postman, `curl -v`, or a network interceptor to inspect the raw HTTP request. Look for unexpected header modifications or payload stripping that might occur during transit.
