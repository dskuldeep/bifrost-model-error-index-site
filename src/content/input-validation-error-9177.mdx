## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error with the message `GenerateContentRequest.contents: contents is not specified` indicates that the request sent to the Google Gemini API (or Vertex AI) is unacceptable due to a missing or empty mandatory field. 

Key reasons include:
1. **Missing Mandatory Field**: The `contents` parameter is a non-optional root-level field in the `GenerateContentRequest` schema. If this key is absent from the JSON body, the API cannot process the request.
2. **Empty or Invalid Payload**: The error occurs if the request payload is provided but the `contents` field is set to an empty array (e.g., `"contents": []`) or a null value.
3. **Improper Formatting**: The request may be improperly structured or nested, preventing the API from correctly identifying the necessary information for content generation.

## Solution
To resolve the `400 Bad Request` error, ensure that the `contents` field is correctly specified, formatted, and populated in your API request body.

Follow these steps to remediate the issue:
1. **Specify the contents Field**: Ensure your JSON request body includes a root-level key named `contents`.
2. **Verify Field Structure**: The `contents` field must be an array containing at least one `Content` object. Each object should include a `parts` array with the prompt data.
   
   Example of a valid structure:
   ```json
   {
     "contents": [
       {
         "role": "user",
         "parts": [
           {
             "text": "Your prompt goes here."
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
3. **Check for Empty Data**: Confirm that your application logic is not sending an empty list to the API. Every request must contain the actual content intended for processing.
4. **Review API Guidelines**: Refer to the official Google AI or Vertex AI documentation for the specific formatting requirements of the model version you are targeting.

Key actions:
1. Include the properly structured `contents` field in your request.
2. Ensure the request payload is valid JSON and not empty.
3. Consult the API documentation for specific schema requirements.
