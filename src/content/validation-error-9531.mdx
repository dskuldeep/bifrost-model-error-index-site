## Reason

The `400 Bad Request` error message `[] is too short - 'functions'` specifically indicates that the `functions` (or the modern `tools`) parameter was sent as an empty array. OpenAI's API schema requires that if these keys are included in the request, they must contain at least one item.

Additional causes for a `400 Bad Request` in the OpenAI API include:
1. **Incorrect or Expired API Keys**: The key provided in the header may be malformed, inactive, or revoked.
2. **Invalid Request Syntax or Configuration**: This includes incorrect base URLs, malformed JSON bodies, or invalid `Authorization` headers.
3. **Exceeding Maximum Context Length**: Requests that exceed the model's maximum token limit (including both input and requested output tokens) will be rejected.
4. **Too Many Headers**: Exceeding the internal limit of 8 request headers can trigger a `TooManyHeaders` error.
5. **Model-Specific Restrictions**: Using parameters that a specific model does not support (e.g., specifying `dimensions` for a model that lacks that capability) results in a validation failure.
6. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: While usually a 429 error, certain rapid-fire validation failures under high load can present as 400 errors if the request quota logic is triggered prematurely.
7. **Server-Side Issues**: Intermittent errors or changes in OpenAI's token counting logic can lead to unexpected validation failures.

## Solution
To resolve the `[] is too short - 'functions'` error, you must ensure that the `functions` or `tools` key is omitted from your JSON payload if no functions are being provided. 

Follow these remediation steps:
1. **Conditionally Pass Functions**: Before sending the request, check if your tools/functions array is empty. Only include the `functions` or `tools` key in the payload if the array length is greater than zero.
2. **Verify API Credentials**: Ensure your API key is correct and currently active in the OpenAI dashboard.
3. **Review Syntax and Headers**: Validate that your request headers are properly formatted and that you are not sending more than 8 headers total.
4. **Manage Token Count**: Calculate the expected token usage using a library like `tiktoken` to ensure the request fits within the model's context window.
5. **Adhere to Model Specs**: Check the OpenAI documentation to confirm that the model you are using supports all provided parameters (e.g., `response_format` or `tool_choice`).
6. **Implement Rate Limit Handling**: Use exponential backoff and retry logic to stay within your account's rate limits.
7. **Monitor API Status**: Check the OpenAI status page if you experience intermittent 400 errors that do not appear to be caused by your request payload.
