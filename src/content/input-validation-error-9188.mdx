## Reason

The Anthropic API returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request error with the message "messages: text content blocks must be non-empty" when a request is submitted containing message blocks that lack actual text content. This validation is strictly enforced because the Claude models require at least some non-empty text input within the `messages` array to process and generate a response.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. Submitting a message object where the `content` field is an empty string (`""`).
2. Passing an empty array `[]` to the `content` field.
3. Using the structured content block format where a block of `type: "text"` has an empty `text` property.
4. Application logic errors that allow `null`, `undefined`, or whitespace-only strings to be passed to the API client during the request construction.

## Solution
To resolve this error, ensure that every message sent in the `messages` array contains valid, non-empty text content. Follow these remediation steps:
1. Verify that each message object in your payload includes a `content` field and that it is not set to `null`.
2. Ensure the `content` string has a length greater than zero. The API will reject requests if the text is entirely empty.
3. If you are using structured content blocks, confirm that every block of type `text` contains a populated `text` field.
4. Remove any empty or null text content blocks from the `messages` array before sending the request to the API.
5. Implement client-side validation or a filtering function to strip out empty messages from the conversation history.
6. Double-check your request payload for formatting errors, such as trailing commas or incorrectly nested objects, that might result in empty content blocks being generated.
