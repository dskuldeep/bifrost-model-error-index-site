## Reason

The Together AI API returns a 400 Bad Request error with the message "Input required" when the server cannot process the request due to missing, malformed, or unauthorized data. Primary causes include:

**Missing Mandatory Fields**

The most specific cause for this error message is the absence of the primary input parameter in the JSON request body. For Chat Completion models, the `messages` array must be provided. For standard Language models, the `prompt` field is required.

**Invalid or Missing API Key**

The API key might be incorrect, expired, or improperly configured. Together AI requires the key to be included in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` token authentication scheme.

**Incorrect Request Syntax or Configuration**

The request may contain invalid syntax, such as JSON typos, incorrect data types (e.g., providing a string for a parameter that expects an integer), or missing required headers.

**Data Schema Violations**

The structure of the data sent may not comply with the API's defined schema, such as including parameters that are not supported by the specific model version being called.

**Rate Limiting**

Exceeding the API's allowed frequency of requests can trigger a 400 error if the gateway rejects the request before it reaches the model inference layer.

**Encoding and Middleware Issues**

Encoding problems, particularly with special characters in the request body, can result in a malformed request. Additionally, configuration issues with libraries like Axios or specific middleware can lead to requests being altered or stripped of content during transmission.

## Solution
To resolve the 400 "Input required" error in the Together AI API, follow these remediation steps:

**1. Verify Mandatory Input Parameters**

Ensure your request body includes the necessary input field for the endpoint you are using:

*   For Chat endpoints: Ensure the `messages` array is present and contains valid message objects.
*   For Completion endpoints: Ensure the `prompt` string is present.

**2. Validate API Authentication**

Ensure your API key is active and correctly formatted in the request header:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

**3. Check Request Syntax and Data Types**

Review the request body for typos or syntax errors. Ensure that values for parameters like `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `top_p` are within valid ranges and use the correct data types (e.g., integers vs. floats).

**4. Ensure Schema Compliance**

Compare your request structure against the official Together AI API documentation to ensure all fields are correctly named and placed within the JSON object.

**5. Handle Encoding Correctly**

Ensure the request body is UTF-8 encoded. If your input contains special characters, verify that your programming environment or library is not corrupting the character encoding.

**6. Review Middleware and Library Configurations**

If using a library like Axios, verify that headers and data are not being modified by interceptors. Log the raw outgoing request to confirm that the body is being sent as expected.

**7. Monitor Rate Limits and Quotas**

Check your Together AI dashboard to ensure you have not exceeded your rate limits or usage quotas, as this can sometimes result in rejected requests.
