## Reason

The error **"Unrecognized request argument supplied: openai_api_key"** occurs when the OpenAI API receives a request parameter that is not part of its official schema. This typically results in a HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status code.

Key reasons for this error include:
1. **Incorrect API Key Placement**: The OpenAI API expects the API key to be passed via the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. If the key is instead included inside the JSON request body (e.g., `"openai_api_key": "sk-..."`) or as a URL query parameter, the API will treat it as an unknown and invalid argument.
2. **Library or Wrapper Misconfiguration**: Some third-party SDKs or community-built wrappers might use different naming conventions for initialization. If these parameters are passed directly to the OpenAI endpoint without being stripped out by the library, the API will reject the request.
3. **Invalid Request Syntax**: General syntax errors in the JSON payload or the inclusion of deprecated parameters can cause the server to fail to parse the request correctly, leading to unrecognized argument errors.

## Solution
To resolve the "Unrecognized request argument supplied" error, ensure your request adheres to the standard OpenAI API specification by following these steps:

**1. Move the API Key to the Authorization Header**
Verify that the API key is not in the request body. It must be sent as a header in the following format:
`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY`

**2. Clean the Request Body**
Review the JSON payload being sent to the API. Ensure that `openai_api_key` and any other non-supported fields are removed from the request body. Only include supported parameters such as `model`, `messages`, `temperature`, etc., as defined in the official API reference.

**3. Validate Request Structure**
Check the structure of your JSON request for formatting issues:
1. Ensure the JSON is well-formed and uses double quotes for keys and string values.
2. Confirm all required fields for the specific endpoint (e.g., `/v1/chat/completions`) are present.
3. Verify that you are using the correct field names (e.g., `max_tokens` instead of `max-tokens`).

**4. Verify Account Quotas and Key Validity**
While the error message specifically mentions an unrecognized argument, ensure your API key is active and that your account has sufficient credits/quota to prevent secondary 401 or 429 errors once the syntax is fixed.

**5. Check Network and Environment**
Ensure that no proxies or middleware are modifying your request body or injecting illegal parameters before it reaches OpenAI's servers.
